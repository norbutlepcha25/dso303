# Lab 13 - Centralized Logging and Monitoring with CloudWatch and X-Ray

*Practical 8 in the delivery schedule, Practical 6 in the module descriptor.*

---

## 1. Objectives

- Inventory the logs and alarms the course already created, then set deliberate retention on every USMS log group and add a central log group.
- Write structured log events, test and deploy metric filters, and publish custom metrics with dimensions.
- Grant telemetry permissions, instrument and trace `usms-transcript-notifier`, and build X-Ray segments, subsegments, annotations and a sampling rule by hand.
- Create a metric alarm, an absence alarm and a composite alarm, prove one fires, and build the `usms-overview` dashboard.
- Prove everything survives a restart, record which features you observed versus only recorded, and save `configs/lab-13.env`.

**Time:** roughly four hours. **Assessment:** Section 13. **Project checkpoint:** the project appendix.

## 2. Prerequisites

- Labs 01 to 12 complete, with their `configs/lab-NN.env` files present. Step 2 tolerates the absent S3 configuration lab (never delivered). Nothing specific from Labs 11 or 12 is required; this lab observes whatever runs in `usms-ecs-cluster`.
- Floci running under Docker Compose, with `FLOCI_STORAGE_MODE` set to `hybrid`.
- A **new** terminal window already has `AWS_PROFILE` and `COURSE_ROOT` set. If not, fix the Errata 01 defect now rather than at Step 13.
- `python3` on your path (millisecond timestamps, hex IDs and JSON, which differ between macOS and Linux in the shell).
- `usms-transcript-notifier` from Lab 10, with its alias `live`.

```bash
cd ~/aws-floci-course
./scripts/utilities/floci-storage-check.sh
./scripts/utilities/verify-lab-10.sh | tail -2
```

You want `PASS=16  FAIL=0` from the first and `PASS=51  FAIL=0` from the second. A failure in the storage check's first block means a new terminal cannot find the course, and the CLI will wrongly blame your credentials.

!!! warning "Do not run `aws login`"
    If you see `NoCredentials`, the AWS CLI v2 suggests `aws login`, which begins a sign-in to **real AWS**. The answer here is always `source configs/course.env` or a missing `floci` profile. See Errata 01 Section 3.

---

## 3. What This Lab Reuses

- The planned S3 configuration lab was never written. Nothing here depends on it: Lab 10 Steps 5 and 20 already built the bucket, objects and notification this lab needs. If that lab is ever written, its `put-bucket-notification-configuration` replaces the whole document and could stop the notifier being invoked, which Step 9's metric filter depends on.

From Lab 01:

- `usms-ec2-app-role`: also gets `USMSObservabilityWrite` in Step 12 (the CloudWatch agent needs exactly these permissions).

From Lab 02:

- `usms-vpc`: a dashboard dimension, and discussed in Section 11 as something you cannot get metrics from locally.

From Lab 04:

- `/usms/ecs/enrolment`: Step 6 sets its retention; it has kept logs forever since Practical 2.

From Lab 06:

- `usms-enrolment-queue-high`: Step 5 reads it back (you have been using CloudWatch alarms since Lab 6); Step 21 contrasts the composite alarm with it.

From Lab 10:

- `/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier`: Step 9 attaches a metric filter to it.
- The `USMS_NOTIFY` marker string: Step 9 turns it into a metric filter pattern.
- `usms-transcript-notifier` alias `live`: Step 13 publishes version 2 and repoints it.
- `usms-lambda-exec-role`: Step 12 attaches the new observability policy alongside `USMSLambdaBasic`.
- `usms-student-data`, `transcripts/evidence/*`: Step 10 uploads an object to make the notifier run.
- `templates/lab-10-s3-event.json`: Step 10's fallback when your build does not deliver S3 notifications.

```text
Created in this lab:
- /usms/central/application ....... the central log group, retention set
- retention policies .............. on every USMS log group, replacing "never expire"
- usms-notify-count ............... metric filter on the notifier's log group
- usms-central-errors ............. metric filter on the central log group
- USMS/Application ................ custom metric namespace, 3 metrics, 2 dimensions
- USMSObservabilityWrite .......... new customer managed policy: logs + metrics + traces
- usms-transcript-notifier v2 ..... instrumented; alias live REPOINTED from 1 to 2
- active tracing .................. TracingConfig Mode=Active on the notifier
- usms-transcripts-sampling ....... X-Ray sampling rule
- usms-transcript-lag-high ........ metric alarm, proven by a forced state transition
- usms-notify-silence ............. metric alarm on an absence, treat-missing-data breaching
- usms-transcript-pipeline-down ... COMPOSITE alarm over the two above
- usms-overview ................... dashboard, 5 widgets
- scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh ... one log line, one metric, one trace, together

Required for future labs:
- USMS_ALARM_LAG_HIGH, USMS_ALARM_NOTIFY_SILENCE -> a future alerting lab (not yet written) attaches SNS actions to these
- outputs/lab-13-alarm-actions-draft.json        -> that same future lab applies it
- USMS/Application namespace                     -> every later lab publishes into it
- USMSObservabilityWrite                         -> attached to any new role that emits telemetry
- usms-overview dashboard                        -> later labs add widgets rather than new dashboards
```

## 4. What We Are Building

One telemetry pipeline in three layers over the existing system. The **log layer** is a retained central log group of structured lines beside the groups the course created by accident. The **metric layer** is two metric filters and three custom metrics, with an alarm for transcript lag, an alarm for the pipeline going *silent*, and a composite alarm so one incident produces one page. The **trace layer** is X-Ray segments for a transcript upload from S3 through the notifier, with searchable annotations, unsearchable metadata and a sampling rule. One dashboard sits on top.

   A trace says "THIS transcript was slow, and 74 of its 120 milliseconds were in render-pdf".

One new **top-level** directory, `project/`, and it needs the one-sentence justification the course
contract asks for: the individual project assessed in the project appendix is a student deliverable rather than
a course artefact, and mixing it into `labs/` would put work that is marked individually inside a
tree that is identical for everyone.

```bash
cd ~/aws-floci-course
mkdir -p labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/transcript-notifier-v2 project/checkpoint-01
ls -d labs/*
```

> Example output:

```text
labs/lab-01-iam  labs/lab-02-vpc  labs/lab-03-ec2  labs/lab-04-ecs
labs/lab-09-eks  labs/lab-10-lambda-edge  labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray
```

> Your own `labs/` listing will include one directory per lab completed so far. The last entry is
> the one that matters here - this lab's own directory.

## 7. Step-by-Step Implementation

!!! info "Run every command from `aws-floci-course/`"
    All paths are relative to the repository root unless a step says otherwise. If a command reports `No such file or directory`, check `pwd`.

!!! tip "Shell variables die with the terminal"
    Every name and ID below is captured into a variable. Step 25 writes them to `configs/lab-13.env` so later labs can use them.

### Step 1 - Start the environment and prove a new terminal can find it

Time-stamped data is the most confusing to debug when the real problem is that nothing is stored, so confirm persistence first.

```bash
cd ~/aws-floci-course
./scripts/setup/floci-up.sh
./scripts/utilities/floci-storage-check.sh
```

`floci-up.sh` is idempotent and refuses to adopt a non-Compose container. The storage check's first block answers "can a new terminal find the course", its second "will today's work survive tonight".

**Expected result**

```text
PASS=16  FAIL=0
```

> Example output - the lines above the total name your own paths and login shell.

**Verify**

Any failure in the first block is the real problem; most below it are consequences. Fix the shell integration with Errata 01 Patch 1 before continuing.

---

### Step 2 - Source every lab environment file that exists, and confirm your identity

Source whatever env files are present and report what was found, rather than assuming every earlier file exists.

```bash
source configs/course.env

for f in configs/lab-01.env configs/lab-02.env configs/lab-03.env \
         configs/lab-04.env configs/lab-05.env configs/lab-06.env \
         configs/lab-07.env configs/lab-08.env configs/lab-09.env \
         configs/lab-10.env configs/lab-11.env configs/lab-12.env; do
  if [ -f "$f" ]; then
    # shellcheck disable=SC1090
    source "$f"
    printf '  sourced  %s\n' "$f"
  else
    printf '  absent   %s\n' "$f"
  fi
done

./scripts/utilities/whoami.sh
```

The files are named rather than globbed (`configs/lab-*.env`), so nothing unintended is sourced and the output states exactly what your repository contains.

**Expected result**

```text
  sourced  configs/lab-01.env
  sourced  configs/lab-02.env
  sourced  configs/lab-03.env
  sourced  configs/lab-04.env
  sourced  configs/lab-05.env
  sourced  configs/lab-06.env
  sourced  configs/lab-07.env
  sourced  configs/lab-08.env
  sourced  configs/lab-09.env
  sourced  configs/lab-10.env
  sourced  configs/lab-11.env
  sourced  configs/lab-12.env

Account : 000000000000
Identity: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:root
Endpoint: http://localhost:4566
```

> Example output - which files are actually present depends on how far through the course you are.
> There is no `configs/lab-NN.env` for the S3 configuration lab, because it has never been written.

**Verify**

```bash
printf 'bucket       : %s\n' "${USMS_BUCKET_NAME:-<UNSET>}"
printf 'notifier     : %s\n' "${USMS_LAMBDA_NOTIFIER_FN:-<UNSET>}"
printf 'notifier log : %s\n' "${USMS_LOG_GROUP_NOTIFIER:-<UNSET>}"
printf 'lambda role  : %s\n' "${USMS_ROLE_LAMBDA:-<UNSET>}"
printf 'account id   : %s\n' "${USMS_ACCOUNT_ID:-<UNSET>}"
```

You want `usms-student-data`, `usms-transcript-notifier`, `/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier`, `usms-lambda-exec-role` and `000000000000`. If `USMS_LOG_GROUP_NOTIFIER` is unset, run `export USMS_LOG_GROUP_NOTIFIER=/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier` and add the line to `configs/lab-10.env`; Steps 6 and 9 read it.

---

### Step 3 - Create this lab's directories and confirm the repository shape

One directory for the instrumented handler, one for the project checkpoint, so no later step fails on a missing parent.

```bash
mkdir -p labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/transcript-notifier-v2 \
         project/checkpoint-01

ls -d labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/*/ project/*/
```

`mkdir -p` is safe to re-run. `project/` (justified in Section 6) is the only directory whose contents differ between students.

**Expected result**

```text
labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/transcript-notifier-v2/
project/checkpoint-01/
```

**Verify**

```bash
test -d labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/transcript-notifier-v2 && echo "source tree ready"
```

---

### Step 4 - Find out what this Floci build actually supports

Logs are usually good, metrics and alarms are stored but not evaluated, Logs Insights is often absent, and X-Ray varies most. Establish which you have, in writing, before depending on it.

```bash
probe() {   # $1 = label, $2 = command to try
  if eval "$2" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    printf '  SUPPORTED    %s\n' "$1"
  else
    printf '  UNSUPPORTED  %s\n' "$1"
  fi
}

{
  printf 'Floci support probe for Lab 13 - %s\n\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  probe "logs       (describe-log-groups)"    "aws logs describe-log-groups --limit 1"
  probe "logs       (put-metric-filter API)"  "aws logs describe-metric-filters --limit 1"
  probe "logs       (Insights start-query)"   "aws logs describe-queries --max-results 1"
  probe "cloudwatch (list-metrics)"           "aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/Lambda"
  probe "cloudwatch (describe-alarms)"        "aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --max-records 1"
  probe "cloudwatch (list-dashboards)"        "aws cloudwatch list-dashboards"
  probe "xray       (get-sampling-rules)"     "aws xray get-sampling-rules"
  probe "xray       (get-service-graph)"      "aws xray get-service-graph --start-time $(date -u -d '-5 minutes' +%s 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-5M +%s) --end-time $(date -u +%s)"
  probe "lambda     (get-function-config)"    "aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name ${USMS_LAMBDA_NOTIFIER_FN:-usms-transcript-notifier}"
} | tee outputs/lab-13-support-probe.txt
```

- `probe` runs a harmless read-only call and reports only whether it returned zero.
- `date -u -d '-5 minutes'` is GNU and `date -u -v-5M` is BSD (macOS); the `||` picks whichever works. From Step 7 the lab uses `python3` for time arithmetic instead.

**Expected result**

```text
Floci support probe for Lab 13 - 2026-09-17T03:41:22Z

  SUPPORTED    logs       (describe-log-groups)
  SUPPORTED    logs       (put-metric-filter API)
  UNSUPPORTED  logs       (Insights start-query)
  SUPPORTED    cloudwatch (list-metrics)
  SUPPORTED    cloudwatch (describe-alarms)
  SUPPORTED    cloudwatch (list-dashboards)
  SUPPORTED    xray       (get-sampling-rules)
  SUPPORTED    xray       (get-service-graph)
  SUPPORTED    lambda     (get-function-config)
```

> Example output - your Insights and X-Ray lines may differ. Both answers are normal and the lab
> handles both.

The first two lines and the `cloudwatch` lines must say `SUPPORTED`. If `describe-log-groups` is `UNSUPPORTED`, stop and read Section 10 (usually Floci is still starting). The other two decide a path:

| Probe | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Insights `UNSUPPORTED` | Step 23 takes the `filter-log-events` path instead of `start-query` |
| X-Ray `UNSUPPORTED` | Steps 15 to 18 validate segment documents structurally and record them, instead of sending them |

Either way, the document you construct and the reasoning behind it, which is what is assessed, still gets produced.

---

### Step 5 - Inventory the monitoring you already have and did not know about

Most monitoring is discovered and organised, not added. Two of your log groups were created by services, and Lab 6's alarm has sat there for two practicals.

!!! info "What CloudWatch holds"
    A **log group** is a container of streams with one retention policy; a **log stream** is events from one source; a **log event** is one timestamped message. A **metric** is a time series identified by namespace, name and **the full set of dimensions**. An **alarm** watches a metric and holds a state; a **dashboard** is a JSON document of widgets. The fact the next steps rely on: **logs are text and metrics are numbers, and nothing turns one into the other automatically**; a metric filter (Step 9) does. Note that `aws logs` and `aws cloudwatch` are two separate CLI services. See [the log data model](../unit7/topic2.md#the-data-model-events-streams-and-groups) and [the metric data model](../unit7/topic1.md#the-metric-data-model).

```bash
{
  printf 'USMS telemetry inventory - %s\n\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"

  printf '== log groups ==\n'
  aws logs describe-log-groups \
    --query 'sort_by(logGroups, &logGroupName)[].[logGroupName,retentionInDays,storedBytes]' \
    --output text

  printf '\n== alarms ==\n'
  aws cloudwatch describe-alarms \
    --query 'MetricAlarms[].[AlarmName,Namespace,MetricName,StateValue]' \
    --output text

  printf '\n== metric namespaces already present ==\n'
  aws cloudwatch list-metrics \
    --query 'sort_by(Metrics, &Namespace)[].Namespace' --output text \
    | tr '\t' '\n' | sort -u

  printf '\n== dashboards ==\n'
  aws cloudwatch list-dashboards --query 'DashboardEntries[].DashboardName' --output text
} | tee outputs/lab-13-telemetry-inventory.txt
```

- `retentionInDays` is absent when no retention policy is set, and `--output text` prints it as `None`. That `None` is the finding.
- `tr '\t' '\n' | sort -u` turns one-row-per-metric into the set of namespaces.

**Expected result**

```text
USMS telemetry inventory - 2026-09-17T03:45:10Z

== log groups ==
/aws/lambda/usms-edge-origin-response	None	412
/aws/lambda/usms-edge-viewer-request	None	1043

== alarms ==

== metric namespaces already present ==

== dashboards ==

```

> Example output - your stored byte counts, and whether the edge function log groups exist at all,
> depend on whether your build delivered logs in Lab 10.

1. **Every `retentionInDays` is `None`**: the default is never expire, the most common avoidable CloudWatch cost. Step 6 fixes it.
2. **You have log groups you never created**: Lambda created three by writing to them; Lab 4's task definition created the ECS one.
3. **There is already an alarm** from Lab 6, probably `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, which is a state, not an error (Step 19).
4. **There are no dashboards.**

!!! note "Floci Limitation - AWS-published metrics mostly do not exist here"
    Real AWS accounts already contain thousands of free metrics in namespaces such as `AWS/Lambda`, `AWS/ApplicationELB`, `AWS/ECS` and `AWS/EC2`.

    Floci publishes few or none; the list above shows only what this course put there.

    So **every metric you alarm on here is one you publish yourself** (Step 11). A custom metric such as `TranscriptsProcessed` is the only kind that measures something specific to your application anyway.

**Checkpoint 1**

```

---

### Step 6 - Create the central log group and set retention on everything

Give USMS one log group any compute tier can write to, then fix Step 5's retention finding on every USMS group.

!!! info "How many log groups"
    **A log group is a unit of retention and access control, not a unit of component.** Group what you keep for the same time and let the same people read; distinguish sources by stream and by a field in the message. See [retention](../unit7/topic2.md#retention).

| Log group | Holds | Retention | Why that number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/usms/central/application` | application events from any compute tier | 30 days | long enough for "what happened last month", short enough to be cheap |
| `/usms/ecs/enrolment` | the enrolment service's container output | 30 days | same class of data, same answer |
| `/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier` | one function's runtime output | 14 days | debugging data; if nobody looked in two weeks, nobody will |

A real university would add a longer-retained, separately controlled group for audit data; Exercise 4 asks you to design it.

**Command - part 1, create the central group**

```bash
CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP=/usms/central/application

aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --query 'length(logGroups)' --output text | grep -q '^0$' \
  && aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  || echo "log group already exists - skipping create"

aws logs put-retention-policy \
  --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --retention-in-days 30
```

```text
aws
 └── logs                        the SERVICE - CloudWatch Logs, separate from `cloudwatch`
      ├── create-log-group       the OPERATION
      └── put-retention-policy   sets how long events in the group are kept
```

- The existence probe (`length(logGroups)` plus `grep -q`) replaces `|| true`, which would hide real failures. `--log-group-name-prefix` is a prefix match.
- `--retention-in-days` accepts only 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1096, 1827, 2192, 2557, 2922, 3288, 3653. There is no 45.

**Command - part 2, fix every USMS log group**

```bash
NOTIFIER_LOG_GROUP="${USMS_LOG_GROUP_NOTIFIER:-/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier}"

set_retention() {   # $1 = log group name, $2 = days
  if aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix "$1" \
       --query "logGroups[?logGroupName=='$1'] | length(@)" --output text | grep -q '^1$'; then
    aws logs put-retention-policy --log-group-name "$1" --retention-in-days "$2"
    printf '  set %4s days on %s\n' "$2" "$1"
  else
    printf '  absent, skipped   %s\n' "$1"
  fi
}

set_retention "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP"                 30
set_retention /usms/ecs/enrolment                  30
set_retention "$NOTIFIER_LOG_GROUP"                14
set_retention /aws/lambda/usms-edge-viewer-request 14
set_retention /aws/lambda/usms-edge-origin-response 14
```

- `logGroups[?logGroupName=='$1'] | length(@)` turns the prefix match into an exact one.
- A function rather than five command pairs, so a missing edge group is reported `absent, skipped` instead of aborting the rest.

**Expected result**

```text
  set   30 days on /usms/central/application
  set   30 days on /usms/ecs/enrolment
  set   14 days on /aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier
  set   14 days on /aws/lambda/usms-edge-viewer-request
  absent, skipped   /aws/lambda/usms-edge-origin-response
```

> Example output - which edge log groups exist depends on whether your build delivered Lambda logs
> in Lab 10.

**Verify**

```bash
aws logs describe-log-groups \
  --query 'sort_by(logGroups, &logGroupName)[].{Group:logGroupName,Days:retentionInDays}' \
  --output table
```

No group starting `/usms/` or `/aws/lambda/usms-` may show `None` in `Days`.

!!! tip "Tagging a log group, if your build supports it"
    `aws logs tag-log-group` is deprecated in favour of `aws logs tag-resource`, which takes a log group **ARN**. Builds differ, so probe:

    ```bash
    LG_ARN=$(aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
      --query "logGroups[?logGroupName=='$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP'].arn | [0]" --output text)

    aws logs tag-resource --resource-arn "$LG_ARN" --tags Project=USMS,Lab=08 2>/dev/null \
      || aws logs tag-log-group --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" --tags Project=USMS,Lab=08 2>/dev/null \
      || echo "neither tagging call is available on this build - record it in the support probe"
    ```

    Nothing later depends on the tag. If both fail, append a line saying so to `outputs/lab-13-support-probe.txt`.

**Checkpoint 2**

```text
LOG LAYER
 ├── /usms/central/application ................. NEW, retention 30d
 ├── /usms/ecs/enrolment ....................... Lab 04, retention 30d  (was never)

 └── /aws/lambda/usms-edge-* ................... Lab 10,  retention 14d  (if present)
```

---

### Step 7 - Write log events, and get the timestamp units right

Put real events into the central group with the call your application code would make.

!!! info "Structured logs, and a marker string as an interface"
    `USMS_EVENT {"event":"transcript.processed","faculty":"science","seconds":0.42}` can be filtered, counted and graphed; a prose sentence cannot. The leading marker lets a filter find your lines among the runtime's `START` / `END` / `REPORT` noise. Once Step 9 matches on it, **it becomes an interface**: change it and the metric silently drops to zero. See [structured logging](../unit7/topic2.md#structured-logging).

```bash
STREAM="lab-13-$(date -u +%Y%m%d)"

aws logs create-log-stream \
  --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --log-stream-name "$STREAM" 2>/dev/null \
  || echo "stream already exists - continuing"

NOW_MS=$(python3 -c 'import time; print(int(time.time()*1000))')

aws logs put-log-events \
  --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --log-stream-name "$STREAM" \
  --log-events \
    timestamp=$((NOW_MS-4000)),message='USMS_EVENT {"event":"transcript.requested","student":"stu-00417","faculty":"science"}' \
    timestamp=$((NOW_MS-2000)),message='USMS_EVENT {"event":"transcript.processed","student":"stu-00417","faculty":"science","seconds":0.42}' \
    timestamp=$((NOW_MS-1000)),message='USMS_EVENT {"event":"transcript.processed","student":"stu-00982","faculty":"engineering","seconds":1.91}' \
    timestamp=$NOW_MS,message='ERROR USMS_EVENT {"event":"transcript.failed","student":"stu-01044","faculty":"science","reason":"render timeout"}' \
  --query 'rejectedLogEventsInfo' --output json
```

- **Timestamps are milliseconds since the epoch.** Seconds land in 1970 and are silently rejected. `python3` produces the value portably; `date +%s%3N` prints a literal `3N` on macOS.
- Events must be in chronological order within one call (hence the decreasing offsets) and inside the ingestion window (about 14 days back, 2 hours forward).
- `rejectedLogEventsInfo` is printed because a call that rejects every event still returns HTTP 200.
- The fourth message starts with `ERROR`; Step 9's second filter matches it.

!!! tip "If your build demands a sequence token"
    Real AWS ignores `sequenceToken` since 2023, but some Floci builds fail with `InvalidSequenceTokenException`. Fetch and pass it:

    ```bash
    TOKEN=$(aws logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
      --log-stream-name-prefix "$STREAM" \
      --query 'logStreams[0].uploadSequenceToken' --output text)

    aws logs put-log-events --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
      --log-stream-name "$STREAM" --sequence-token "$TOKEN" --log-events ...
    ```

    Record the substitution in `outputs/lab-13-support-probe.txt`.

**Expected result**

```text
null
```

> Example output - `null` means nothing was rejected, and it is the answer you want.

**Verify**

```bash
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --query 'events[].[timestamp,message]' --output text
```

Four rows in ascending timestamp order with payloads intact. Zero rows after a `null` means your timestamps are in seconds.

✏️ **Your turn**

Send a fifth event that a filter should **not** match, so that Step 9 has a negative case to prove
itself against.

Write one more event to the same stream whose message contains neither `USMS_EVENT` nor `ERROR` -
something like a plain health-check line - with a timestamp later than the four above.

```text
Expected result:
rejectedLogEventsInfo is null again.
filter-log-events now returns 5 rows.
Nothing in Step 9 will count this one, and that is the point of having sent it.
```

**Checkpoint 3**

```text
/usms/central/application
 └── stream lab-13-20260917
      ├── USMS_EVENT transcript.requested   stu-00417  science
      ├── USMS_EVENT transcript.processed   stu-00417  science      0.42s
      ├── USMS_EVENT transcript.processed   stu-00982  engineering  1.91s
      ├── ERROR USMS_EVENT transcript.failed stu-01044 science
      └── (your turn) one non-matching line
```

---

### Step 8 - Test a filter pattern before you deploy it

A filter that matches nothing yields a metric that is always zero, an alarm that never fires and a healthy-looking dashboard, with no error anywhere. `test-metric-filter` prevents that.

!!! info "Filter patterns are not regular expressions"
    For text, terms match whitespace-delimited tokens, **case-sensitively**: `ERROR timeout` needs both, `?ERROR ?WARN` either, `ERROR -Test` excludes `Test`; quote terms with punctuation. There is no `.*` or anchoring. The JSON dialect (`{ $.faculty = "science" }`, `{ $.seconds > 1 }`) applies only when the **whole message** is JSON, so `USMS_EVENT {...}` lines are matched by the text dialect. Exercise 2 weighs the alternative. See [metric filters](../unit7/topic2.md#metric-filters).

```bash
aws logs test-metric-filter \
  --filter-pattern 'USMS_NOTIFY' \
  --log-event-messages \
    'USMS_NOTIFY {"bucket": "usms-student-data", "key": "transcripts/evidence/a.json", "readable": true}' \
    'usms-transcript-notifier: 1 record(s), channel=stdout, bucket_hint=usms-student-data' \
    'REPORT RequestId: 4c8e	Duration: 18.42 ms	Billed Duration: 19 ms' \
    'skipping non-transcript object: notes/ignore-me.json' \
  --query 'matches[].[eventNumber,eventMessage]' --output table \
  | tee outputs/lab-13-filter-test.json
```

- `test-metric-filter` touches no log group and creates nothing; it works before the group exists.
- The four samples are the four kinds of line Lab 10's notifier really emits, so the pattern is tested against the real population.
- `eventNumber` is the **1-based** index of the matching message.

**Expected result**

```text
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                TestMetricFilter                                  |
+-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1  |  USMS_NOTIFY {"bucket": "usms-student-data", "key": "transcripts/...       |
+-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

> Example output - the message is truncated by the table width, not by the API.

Exactly one match, number 1. A match on message 2 would double-count every invocation; no match usually means wrong case (`usms_notify` matches nothing).

✏️ **Your turn**

Design the pattern for the *other* filter before Step 9 deploys it.

Using `test-metric-filter` only, find a pattern that matches the `ERROR` line you wrote in Step 7 and
does **not** match the three successful `USMS_EVENT` lines. Then check what your pattern does to a
line reading `USMS_EVENT {"event":"transcript.processed","reason":"no ERROR here"}` - a false
positive you will not have thought of.

```text
Expected result:
A pattern with exactly one match against your four Step 7 messages.
An honest note in labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/exercises.md about what the
false-positive line did, and whether you would accept it in production.
```

---

### Step 9 - Deploy two metric filters

Turn the two patterns into standing rules: from now on a matching log line produces a metric data point with no `put-metric-data` call.

!!! info "What a metric filter costs you"
    A filter runs at **ingestion**, so it is not retroactive (for last week, use Insights in Step 23). Its output is a billed metric, and a dimension taken from a log field creates one metric per distinct value, which is why neither filter below has dimensions. `defaultValue` decides what *nothing* means: with `0`, a quiet period is a zero; without it, there is no data point, and Step 19 depends on that difference.

```bash
aws logs put-metric-filter \
  --log-group-name "$NOTIFIER_LOG_GROUP" \
  --filter-name usms-notify-count \
  --filter-pattern 'USMS_NOTIFY' \
  --metric-transformations \
      metricName=NotifyCount,metricNamespace=USMS/Application,metricValue=1,defaultValue=0

aws logs put-metric-filter \
  --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --filter-name usms-central-errors \
  --filter-pattern 'ERROR' \
  --metric-transformations \
      metricName=CentralErrorCount,metricNamespace=USMS/Application,metricValue=1,defaultValue=0
```

```text
aws
 └── logs
      └── put-metric-filter
           ├── --log-group-name           which group is watched
           ├── --filter-name              the filter's name, unique within the group
           ├── --filter-pattern           what counts as a match (Step 8's dialect)
           └── --metric-transformations   what to publish when it matches
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `metricName` | the metric's name - `NotifyCount` |
| `metricNamespace` | the namespace, which is how you keep your metrics apart from AWS's |
| `metricValue` | what to publish per match. `1` counts events; `$1` or `$.field` publishes a value **extracted from the line** |
| `defaultValue` | what to publish for a period with no matches |

- `metricValue='$.seconds'` on a JSON line would give a latency metric with no code change (Exercise 1).
- Both filters publish into `USMS/Application`, alongside Step 11's custom metrics. One namespace per application is what makes a dashboard possible.

**Expected result**

Neither call prints anything on success.

**Verify**

```bash
aws logs describe-metric-filters \
  --query 'metricFilters[?starts_with(filterName, `usms-`)].[filterName,logGroupName,filterPattern,metricTransformations[0].metricName]' \
  --output table
```

Two rows, each pairing the right filter with the right log group. A filter on the wrong group is hard to spot later because both objects look correct alone.

```text
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                     DescribeMetricFilters                                    |

|  usms-central-errors |  /usms/central/application            |  ERROR        | CentralErrorCount |

### Step 10 - Prove the filter end to end

Create, perturb, read back: make the notifier run, then look for the metric.

**Command - part 1, perturb**

```bash
BUCKET="${USMS_BUCKET_NAME:-usms-student-data}"
NOTIFIER="${USMS_LAMBDA_NOTIFIER_FN:-usms-transcript-notifier}"

python3 -c "
import json, datetime
json.dump({'note': 'lab-13 telemetry probe',
           'created': datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat()},
          open('outputs/lab-13-probe-object.json','w'), indent=2)
"

aws s3api put-object \
  --bucket "$BUCKET" \
  --key transcripts/evidence/lab-13-probe-object.json \
  --body outputs/lab-13-probe-object.json \
  --content-type application/json \
  --query 'ETag' --output text

sleep 5

aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name "$NOTIFIER" \
  --qualifier live \
  --payload fileb://templates/lab-10-s3-event.json \
  --query 'FunctionError' --output text \
  outputs/lab-13-notifier-probe.json
```

- The upload matches Lab 10's notification filter (`transcripts/` prefix, `.json` suffix), so builds that deliver S3 events invoke the notifier.
- The direct `invoke` runs **every time**, not only on failure: the upload proves delivery, the invoke proves the function and filter regardless.
- `templates/lab-10-s3-event.json` is Lab 10 Step 21's synthetic event, reused.

**Command - part 2, read back**

```bash
WINDOW=$(python3 -c "
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).replace(microsecond=0)
start = now - datetime.timedelta(minutes=15)
print(start.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'), now.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'))
")
START=${WINDOW% *}
END=${WINDOW#* }

printf 'window: %s .. %s\n' "$START" "$END"

aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace USMS/Application \
  --metric-name NotifyCount \
  --start-time "$START" \
  --end-time "$END" \
  --period 60 \
  --statistics Sum SampleCount \
  --query 'sort_by(Datapoints, &Timestamp)[].[Timestamp,Sum,SampleCount]' \
  --output table \
  | tee outputs/lab-13-metric-readback.json
```

- One `python3` process prints both window ends; `${WINDOW% *}` and `${WINDOW#* }` split them (avoiding Step 4's `date` portability bug).
- `--period 60` is the aggregation granularity, a multiple of 60; finer than the publishing rate gives gaps.
- For a counting metric use `Sum` (matching lines) and `SampleCount`; `Average` of a count means nothing.

**Expected result**

```text
window: 2026-09-17T04:02:00Z .. 2026-09-17T04:17:00Z
-------------------------------------------------
|              GetMetricStatistics              |
+---------------------------+--------+----------+
|  2026-09-17T04:14:00Z     |  2.0   |   2.0    |
+---------------------------+--------+----------+
```

> Example output - your timestamp and counts will differ, and one or two data points are both normal
> depending on whether the upload also fired.

At least one data point with `Sum` of 1 or more: a log line, turned into a metric by your rule, read back by a third API.

!!! note "Floci Limitation - metric filters are often stored but not evaluated"
    Many Floci builds store and return the filter but never run it, so `Datapoints` is empty.

    Real AWS evaluates every filter against every event at ingestion, within seconds.

    **If `Datapoints` is empty,** publish the metric by hand so the rest of the lab has data, and record in `outputs/lab-13-support-probe.txt` that the value is synthetic:

    ```bash
    aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
      --namespace USMS/Application \
      --metric-data MetricName=NotifyCount,Unit=Count,Value=2
    ```

    Re-run the `get-metric-statistics` above. You lose evidence that the *filter* works and keep everything downstream; say which you have in your write-up (Section 13 rewards it).

✏️ **Your turn**

Show that `defaultValue` is doing something.

Pick a fifteen-minute window that ends **before** you uploaded anything today, ask for `NotifyCount`
over it with a period of 300, and compare the result to a window that includes the upload.

```text
Expected result:
Two answers that differ, and a one-sentence note in your exercises file saying what an
EMPTY Datapoints list means as against a list full of zeroes - and which of the two your
build actually produced.
```

**Checkpoint 5**

```text

```

---

### Step 11 - Publish custom metrics, and meet dimensions

A custom metric measures whatever you decide; `TranscriptsProcessed` by `Faculty` is not something AWS could publish for you.

!!! info "A dimension is part of the name, not a label on it"
    A metric's identity is namespace + name + the **complete set** of dimensions; change any and it is a different metric. There is **no automatic roll-up**, so a total must be published as its own dimensionless data point. **Cardinality is cost**: each distinct dimension combination is a billed metric, so `Faculty` (about eight values) is a good dimension and `StudentId` (thirty thousand) belongs in a log field or an X-Ray annotation. See [the metric data model](../unit7/topic1.md#the-metric-data-model) and [cardinality](../unit7/topic1.md#cardinality).

```text
USMS/Application  TranscriptsProcessed  {Faculty=science}                  metric A

USMS/Application  TranscriptsProcessed  {Faculty=science, Stage=render}    metric C  ← NOT a subset of A
USMS/Application  TranscriptsProcessed  {}                                 metric D  ← NOT the total
```

**Command - part 1, the shorthand form**

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
  --namespace USMS/Application \
  --metric-data \
    'MetricName=TranscriptsProcessed,Unit=Count,Value=1,Dimensions=[{Name=Faculty,Value=science},{Name=Stage,Value=notify}]'

aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
  --namespace USMS/Application \
  --metric-data 'MetricName=TranscriptsProcessed,Unit=Count,Value=1'
```

- `Dimensions=[{Name=...,Value=...}]` is a nested list in shorthand, the limit of readability. Beyond it, use `file://` JSON (part 2).
- The second call publishes the same event with no dimensions: the total.

**Command - part 2, the JSON form, with timestamps**

```bash
NOW_ISO=$(python3 -c "
import datetime
print(datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).replace(microsecond=0).isoformat().replace('+00:00','Z'))
")

cat > templates/lab-13-metric-data.json << EOF

```

- `<< EOF` is **unquoted** because `${NOW_ISO}` must expand at write time; it is one of three unquoted heredocs in this lab, every other is quoted.
- An explicit `Timestamp` matters for batch publishing; data points may be up to two weeks old or two hours ahead, with silent rejection outside that.
- Two `TranscriptLagSeconds` points with the same identity and timestamp aggregate (`SampleCount` 2, `Maximum` 1.91). Publish every observation, never a pre-averaged value.
- Keep `Unit` consistent: `Count` and `Seconds` for one metric become two series that never overlay.
- `EdgeDenyCount` records what Lab 10's viewer-request function would have counted; Floci publishes nothing automatically (see Section 11).

**Expected result**

```text

```

> Both `put-metric-data` calls print nothing on success. That is normal and it is also the reason the

```bash
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace USMS/Application \

  --period 300 \
  --statistics SampleCount Sum Average Maximum \
  --query 'Datapoints[0]' --output json
```

`list-metrics` shows `TranscriptsProcessed` **twice** (with and without dimensions), and the statistics show `SampleCount: 2.0`, `Maximum: 1.91`.

```text
{
    "Timestamp": "2026-09-17T04:15:00+00:00",
    "SampleCount": 2.0,
    "Sum": 2.33,
    "Average": 1.165,
    "Maximum": 1.91,
    "Unit": "Seconds"
}
```

> Example output - your timestamp will differ; the four statistics should not.

If this returns nothing, `--dimensions` does not match the published set **exactly**; asking with no dimensions queries a metric you never published.

### Step 12 - Give the roles permission to emit telemetry

`usms-lambda-exec-role` cannot publish metrics or send traces. On real AWS, active tracing (Step 14) without `xray:PutTraceSegments` produces no traces and no error.

!!! info "Add a policy, do not edit one"
    Editing `USMSLambdaBasic` would change what every holder can do and drag `s3:GetObject` onto every telemetry-emitting role; a managed policy also holds at most **five versions**. A separate policy per concern can be attached to EC2, ECS and EKS roles alike. See [IAM policies](../unit8/topic1.md#iam-policies-and-permissions).

**Command - part 1, the policy document**

```bash
cat > policies/usms-observability-write-policy.json << 'EOF'
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "WriteApplicationLogs",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:000000000000:log-group:/usms/*:*",
        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:000000000000:log-group:/aws/lambda/usms-*:*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "PublishCustomMetricsInOurNamespaceOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "cloudwatch:namespace": "USMS/Application"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "SendTraces",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "xray:PutTraceSegments",
        "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
        "xray:GetSamplingRules",
        "xray:GetSamplingTargets"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

python3 -m json.tool policies/usms-observability-write-policy.json > /dev/null && echo "valid JSON"
```

- `<< 'EOF'` is **quoted**: a policy document must not be expanded. With no `$` in it, an unquoted heredoc would appear to work, which is the trap Lab 10 Step 17 named.
- The log ARNs end in `:*`, which covers the **streams**. Without it, `CreateLogStream` works and `PutLogEvents` fails.
- `cloudwatch:PutMetricData` only accepts `Resource: "*"`, so the `cloudwatch:namespace` condition confines it; otherwise it could write into `AWS/Lambda`.
- X-Ray sending has no resource-level control. `GetSamplingRules`/`GetSamplingTargets` are needed or the SDK silently falls back to a local default.

**Command - part 2, create and attach**

```bash
OBS_POLICY_ARN=$(aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name USMSObservabilityWrite \
  --policy-document file://policies/usms-observability-write-policy.json \
  --description "Write logs to USMS groups, publish USMS/Application metrics, send X-Ray traces" \
  --query 'Policy.Arn' --output text 2>/dev/null \
  || aws iam list-policies --scope Local \
       --query "Policies[?PolicyName=='USMSObservabilityWrite'].Arn | [0]" --output text)

echo "$OBS_POLICY_ARN"

for role in "${USMS_ROLE_LAMBDA:-usms-lambda-exec-role}" "${USMS_ROLE_EC2:-usms-ec2-app-role}"; do
  aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name "$role" --policy-arn "$OBS_POLICY_ARN" \
    && printf '  attached to %s\n' "$role"
done
```

- The `|| aws iam list-policies` branch makes the step idempotent: on `EntityAlreadyExists` it looks the ARN up instead.
- `usms-ec2-app-role` gets it too: the CloudWatch agent on `usms-web-01` (conceptual, Section 11) needs exactly these statements.
- `attach-role-policy` is idempotent on real AWS and most builds.

**Expected result**

```text
valid JSON
arn:aws:iam::000000000000:policy/USMSObservabilityWrite
  attached to usms-lambda-exec-role
  attached to usms-ec2-app-role
```

> Example output - the account is always `000000000000` in Floci.

**Verify**

```bash
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name "${USMS_ROLE_LAMBDA:-usms-lambda-exec-role}" \
  --query 'AttachedPolicies[].PolicyName' --output text

aws iam get-policy-version \
  --policy-arn "$OBS_POLICY_ARN" \
  --version-id "$(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn "$OBS_POLICY_ARN" \
                    --query 'Policy.DefaultVersionId' --output text)" \
  --query 'PolicyVersion.Document.Statement[].[Sid,Effect]' --output table
```

Both `USMSLambdaBasic` **and** `USMSObservabilityWrite` on the role, and three statements in the document.

!!! note "Floci Limitation - this permission is not enforced, and it still matters"
    Floci does not evaluate IAM; every call here, and Step 14's tracing, behaves the same with no policy at all.

    Real AWS refuses `PutMetricData` outside the condition's namespace, and a traced function lacking `xray:PutTraceSegments` silently produces no traces.

    Judge the policy by reading it: check the trailing `:*` on the log group ARNs and the `cloudwatch:namespace` condition.

```

### Step 13 - Instrument the notifier, and use an alias for what aliases are for

Version 2 of the notifier publishes metrics and logs a trace ID. Publishing it and repointing `live` deploys it to every trigger without touching any of them.

```text
usms-student-data  notification config  →  arn:...:function:usms-transcript-notifier:live
                                                                                      │
      before this step  live ──→ 1                                                    │
      after  this step  live ──→ 2                                          unchanged ┘
```

The bucket notification and Lab 10 Step 19's resource policy name the alias, so neither is reconfigured. One `update-alias` call is the deployment; the reverse call is the rollback.

**Command - part 1, the instrumented handler**

```bash
cat > labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/transcript-notifier-v2/notifier.py << 'EOF'
"""usms-transcript-notifier, version 2 - instrumented.

- `<< 'EOF'` is quoted so the Python source is written exactly as typed.
- `trace_id` extracts `Root=` from `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` (set by active tracing) and logs it on every line: the join key between logs and traces. It falls back to `aws_request_id`.
- `publish` never fails the invocation; monitoring that throws turns a CloudWatch blip into an outage.
- `faculty_of` guards a user-controlled path segment (`isalpha()`, length) before using it as a dimension, defending against Step 11's cardinality cost.

- The subshell around `cd` (Lab 10 Step 8) keeps `notifier.py` at the zip root and returns you to where you were even on failure.
- `update-function-code` changes `$LATEST` only; immutable version 1 still holds Lab 10's handler, so rollback is instant.
- `wait function-updated-v2` prevents publishing a version of the *old* code mid-update; the `||` sleep is weaker and says so.
- `update-alias` is the deployment.

`Version` is `"2"`, the decoded log has a `USMS_SUMMARY` line, and the payload has `trace_id` and `seconds`. `openssl base64 -d -A` is portable where `base64 -d`/`-D` differ (Lab 10 Step 10).

✏️ **Your turn**

Roll back, confirm, roll forward again.

Point `live` at version 1, invoke through the alias, and observe that the returned payload no longer
has a `trace_id` field. Then point it back at version 2. Do not delete any version.

```text

### Step 14 - Turn on active tracing

Make the runtime give the function a trace ID.

| `Mode` | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `PassThrough` | the default. Trace only if the caller already decided to. The function does not start traces |
| `Active` | Lambda samples the invocation itself and starts a trace, whether or not the caller traced |
| (no config) | equivalent to `PassThrough` |

The question is **who owns the sampling decision**. Behind a front door you control, the front door decides and downstream uses `PassThrough`. The notifier is triggered by S3, which carries no sampling decision, so it needs `Active`. Getting this backwards produces partial traces with nothing visibly wrong.

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name "$NOTIFIER" \
  --tracing-config Mode=Active \
  --query '{Name:FunctionName,Tracing:TracingConfig.Mode}' --output table

aws lambda wait function-updated-v2 --function-name "$NOTIFIER" 2>/dev/null \
  || { echo "waiter unsupported - pausing instead"; sleep 5; }

NOTIFIER_V3=$(aws lambda publish-version \
  --function-name "$NOTIFIER" \
  --description "Lab 13 - instrumented + active tracing" \
  --query 'Version' --output text)

aws lambda update-alias \
  --function-name "$NOTIFIER" --name live \
  --function-version "$NOTIFIER_V3" \
  --query 'FunctionVersion' --output text
```

Tracing is a **configuration** change, and a version freezes code *and* configuration (Lab 10 Step 11), so it needs version 3. Leaving `live` on version 2 would trace `$LATEST` but not what the trigger invokes.

**Expected result**

```text
---------------------------------------------
|         UpdateFunctionConfiguration        |
+---------------------------+----------------+
|           Name            |    Tracing     |
+---------------------------+----------------+
|  usms-transcript-notifier |     Active     |
+---------------------------+----------------+
3
```

> Example output - your version number may differ.

**Verify**

```bash
aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name "$NOTIFIER" --qualifier live \
  --query '{Version:Version,Tracing:TracingConfig.Mode}' --output json

aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name "${USMS_ROLE_LAMBDA:-usms-lambda-exec-role}" \
  --query "AttachedPolicies[?PolicyName=='USMSObservabilityWrite'] | length(@)" --output text
```

`Version: "3"` with `Tracing: "Active"`, and `1` from the second command. Together these are the whole real-AWS precondition for tracing; the second is the half that fails silently.

!!! note "Floci Limitation - active tracing does not produce segments locally"
    Floci stores `TracingConfig` but runs no X-Ray daemon, so invocations produce no segment and `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` may be absent (hence Step 13's fallback).

    Real AWS starts a segment per sampled invocation, with subsegments for cold start and every instrumented SDK call.

    Steps 15 to 17 build and send segments by hand, which is the better way to learn the data model anyway.

### Step 15 - The X-Ray data model, and your first segment

Everything in X-Ray (service graph, latency, error analytics) is derived from segment documents. Build one by hand to see what the SDK does for you.

!!! info "Trace, segment, subsegment, annotation, metadata"
    A **trace** is the set of segments sharing a trace ID; a **segment** is one service's view of the request, named after the service; a **subsegment** is a unit of work inside it. Facts the next steps rely on: X-Ray times are epoch **seconds as a float** (CloudWatch Logs used integer milliseconds); a trace ID embeds its epoch second, and one more than about 30 days old is rejected, so you cannot back-fill. **Annotations** are indexed and searchable (string, number or boolean only); **metadata** is any JSON and not searchable. See [segments](../unit7/topic1.md#traces-segments-subsegments-and-spans) and [annotations versus metadata](../unit7/topic1.md#annotations-versus-metadata).

```text
TRACE            one request, end to end. Identified by a trace id.
 │               Not an object you create - it is the set of segments sharing an id.
 │
 ├── SEGMENT     one service's view of that request.
 │   │           Named after the SERVICE, not the operation. Has its own id.
 │   │
 │   ├── SUBSEGMENT   one unit of work inside that service:
 │   │                a downstream call, a function worth timing, a block of code.
 │   └── SUBSEGMENT
 │
 └── SEGMENT     the next service's view of the SAME request
```

| Field | Shape | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trace_id` | `1-` + 8 hex digits of the epoch second + `-` + 24 hex digits of randomness | `1-68ca4f31-1f2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6` |
| `id` | 16 hex digits | `70de5b6f19ff9a0a` |
| `parent_id` | the `id` of the enclosing segment or subsegment | |
| `start_time`, `end_time` | epoch **seconds**, as a floating point number | `1789234567.123` |

```bash
python3 - << 'PY' > templates/lab-13-segment-parent.json
import json, os, time

now = time.time()
trace_id = "1-%08x-%s" % (int(now), os.urandom(12).hex())
seg_id = os.urandom(8).hex()

segment = {
    "name": "usms-transcript-notifier",
    "id": seg_id,
    "trace_id": trace_id,
    "start_time": round(now - 0.120, 3),
    "end_time": round(now, 3),
    "origin": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
    "annotations": {
        "faculty": "science",
        "stage": "notify",
        "transcript_bytes": 2184,
        "readable": True
    },
    "metadata": {
        "usms": {
            "key": "transcripts/science/stu-00417.json",
            "bucket": "usms-student-data",
            "alias": "live",
            "handler": "notifier.handler"
        }
    }
}

print(json.dumps(segment, indent=2))
with open("outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt", "a") as fh:
    fh.write("%s %s parent\n" % (trace_id, seg_id))
PY

python3 -m json.tool templates/lab-13-segment-parent.json > /dev/null && echo "valid JSON"
tail -1 outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt
```

- `python3 - << 'PY' > file` runs an inline program into a file; the heredoc is **quoted** so the shell expands nothing.
- `os.urandom(12).hex()` and `os.urandom(8).hex()` give 24 and 16 hex characters identically on every platform.
- IDs are appended to `outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt` because Steps 16 and 17 need them and they cannot be derived.
- **A high-cardinality value is exactly right in an annotation and exactly wrong in a metric dimension** (contrast Step 11).

**Command - send it**

```bash
aws xray put-trace-segments \
  --trace-segment-documents "$(cat templates/lab-13-segment-parent.json)" \
  --query 'UnprocessedTraceSegments' --output json
```

- `--trace-segment-documents` takes a list of JSON **strings**, so `"$(cat ...)"` must be quoted or the shell splits it.
- **A batch API reports per-item failure in the response body, not the exit code** (as with `rejectedLogEventsInfo` in Step 7).

**Expected result**

```text
[]
```

> Example output - an empty list means every segment was accepted.

An empty list. A populated one names the segment and reason, usually a malformed `trace_id`, missing `end_time` or wrong-length `id`.

!!! note "Floci Limitation - X-Ray support varies more than any other service in this course"
    Builds have full support, storage only (`put-trace-segments` accepts but `get-trace-summaries` returns nothing), or no X-Ray at all.

    Real AWS indexes the segment within seconds, merges segments by trace ID, derives a service graph, and keeps traces 30 days.

    Step 4 told you which you have. If Step 16 reads back nothing, use its structural validation script and record it; the document is the assessable artefact either way.

---

### Step 16 - Subsegments, a downstream service, and reading a trace back

A trace answers *where* rather than *how long* once it has internal structure and more than one service.

**Command - part 1, the same segment with subsegments**

```bash
TRACE_ID=$(awk 'END {print $1}' outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt)
PARENT_ID=$(awk 'END {print $2}' outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt)

printf 'trace  : %s\nparent : %s\n' "$TRACE_ID" "$PARENT_ID"

python3 - "$TRACE_ID" "$PARENT_ID" << 'PY' > templates/lab-13-segment-subsegments.json
import json, os, sys, time

trace_id, parent_id = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
now = time.time()

def sub(name, offset, duration, namespace, extra=None):
    doc = {
        "id": os.urandom(8).hex(),
        "name": name,
        "start_time": round(now - offset, 3),
        "end_time": round(now - offset + duration, 3),
        "namespace": namespace,
    }
    if extra:
        doc.update(extra)
    return doc

segment = {
    "name": "usms-transcript-notifier",
    "id": parent_id,
    "trace_id": trace_id,
    "start_time": round(now - 0.120, 3),
    "end_time": round(now, 3),
    "origin": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
    "annotations": {
        "faculty": "science",
        "stage": "notify",
        "transcript_bytes": 2184,
        "readable": True,
    },
    "metadata": {
        "usms": {
            "key": "transcripts/science/stu-00417.json",
            "bucket": "usms-student-data",
            "alias": "live",
        }
    },
    "subsegments": [
        sub("s3-head-object", 0.118, 0.018, "aws", {
            "aws": {"operation": "HeadObject",
                    "bucket_name": "usms-student-data",
                    "region": "us-east-1"}}),
        sub("render-pdf", 0.098, 0.074, "remote", {
            "metadata": {"usms": {"pages": 3, "renderer": "wkhtmltopdf"}}}),
        sub("cloudwatch-put-metric-data", 0.022, 0.011, "aws", {
            "aws": {"operation": "PutMetricData"}}),
    ],
}

print(json.dumps(segment, indent=2))
PY

python3 -m json.tool templates/lab-13-segment-subsegments.json > /dev/null && echo "valid JSON"
```

- `awk 'END {print $1}'` prints the first field of the last line, identically on macOS and Linux.
- `python3 - "$TRACE_ID" "$PARENT_ID"` passes values as `sys.argv` instead of interpolating them into source (Lab 10 Appendix B).
- The segment **ID is the same** as Step 15's: resending an existing ID updates the segment rather than duplicating it.

| `namespace` | Meaning | Effect on the service graph |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws` | a call to an AWS service, described by the `aws` block | the service appears as its own node |
| `remote` | a call to something outside AWS | appears as a generic downstream node |
| omitted | internal work inside this service | no node; contributes to the parent's time |

**Command - part 2, a second service in the same trace**

```bash
python3 - "$TRACE_ID" "$PARENT_ID" << 'PY' > templates/lab-13-segment-downstream.json
import json, os, sys, time

trace_id, parent_id = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
now = time.time()

segment = {
    "name": "usms-student-data",
    "id": os.urandom(8).hex(),
    "trace_id": trace_id,
    "parent_id": parent_id,
    "type": "subsegment",
    "start_time": round(now - 0.118, 3),
    "end_time": round(now - 0.100, 3),
    "origin": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
    "http": {
        "request": {"method": "HEAD",
                    "url": "https://usms-student-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/transcripts/science/stu-00417.json"},
        "response": {"status": 200, "content_length": 2184},
    },
    "annotations": {"faculty": "science", "stage": "origin"},
}

print(json.dumps(segment, indent=2))
PY

python3 -m json.tool templates/lab-13-segment-downstream.json > /dev/null && echo "valid JSON"

aws xray put-trace-segments \
  --trace-segment-documents \
    "$(cat templates/lab-13-segment-subsegments.json)" \
    "$(cat templates/lab-13-segment-downstream.json)" \
  --query 'UnprocessedTraceSegments' --output json
```

- `parent_id` plus `"type": "subsegment"` lets a separate process report work inside the caller's segment; X-Ray stitches it in by `trace_id` and `parent_id`.
- `--trace-segment-documents` now takes two strings.
- `http.response.status` is recognised: X-Ray classifies ok, error (4xx), fault (5xx) or throttle (429) from it. In metadata it would do nothing.

**Expected result**

```text
valid JSON
valid JSON
[]
```

**Command - part 3, read it back**

```bash
XW=$(python3 -c "
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).replace(microsecond=0)
start = now - datetime.timedelta(minutes=15)
print(int(start.timestamp()), int(now.timestamp()))
")
XSTART=${XW% *}
XEND=${XW#* }

aws xray get-trace-summaries \
  --start-time "$XSTART" --end-time "$XEND" \
  --query 'TraceSummaries[].{Id:Id,Duration:Duration,Http:Http.HttpStatus,Annotations:keys(Annotations)}' \
  --output json | tee outputs/lab-13-trace-summaries.json

aws xray batch-get-traces --trace-ids "$TRACE_ID" \
  --query 'Traces[0].{Id:Id,Duration:Duration,Segments:length(Segments)}' \
  --output json
```

- `get-trace-summaries` searches a **time window** and returns cheap summaries; `batch-get-traces` fetches up to five full traces by ID.
- `keys(Annotations)` returns an object's key names (new JMESPath).

**Expected result**

```text
[
    {
        "Id": "1-68ca4f31-1f2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6",
        "Duration": 0.12,
        "Http": null,
        "Annotations": [
            "faculty",
            "stage",
            "transcript_bytes",
            "readable"
        ]
    }
]
{
    "Id": "1-68ca4f31-1f2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6",
    "Duration": 0.12,
    "Segments": 2
}
```

> Example output - your trace id and duration will differ. `Segments: 2` is the number to look at.

`Segments` is 2: two independently sent documents merged into one trace. If only `batch-get-traces` returns it, your build stores without indexing; record that and use `batch-get-traces` for the rest of the lab.

**If both return nothing**, validate structurally instead and move on:

```bash
python3 - << 'PY' | tee outputs/lab-13-trace-summaries.json
import json, re, sys

checks, errors = [], []

def check(label, ok):
    checks.append(("ok  " if ok else "FAIL") + "  " + label)
    if not ok:
        errors.append(label)

docs = {name: json.load(open("templates/lab-13-segment-%s.json" % name))
        for name in ("parent", "subsegments", "downstream")}

tid = docs["parent"]["trace_id"]
check("trace id matches 1-<8hex>-<24hex>", bool(re.fullmatch(r"1-[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{24}", tid)))
check("all three documents share one trace id",
      all(d["trace_id"] == tid for d in docs.values()))
check("every id is 16 hex characters",
      all(re.fullmatch(r"[0-9a-f]{16}", d["id"]) for d in docs.values()))
check("parent and subsegment documents share one segment id",
      docs["parent"]["id"] == docs["subsegments"]["id"])
check("downstream names the parent segment",
      docs["downstream"].get("parent_id") == docs["parent"]["id"])
check("every end_time is after its start_time",
      all(d["end_time"] > d["start_time"] for d in docs.values()))
check("three subsegments declared", len(docs["subsegments"]["subsegments"]) == 3)
check("every subsegment fits inside its parent's window",
      all(docs["subsegments"]["start_time"] <= s["start_time"]
          and s["end_time"] <= docs["subsegments"]["end_time"]
          for s in docs["subsegments"]["subsegments"]))
check("annotations hold only string, number or boolean",
      all(isinstance(v, (str, int, float, bool))
          for d in docs.values() for v in d.get("annotations", {}).values()))
check("downstream carries an http status", "status" in docs["downstream"]["http"]["response"])

print(json.dumps({"mode": "structural validation only - X-Ray not readable on this build",
                  "checks": checks, "errors": errors}, indent=2))
sys.exit(1 if errors else 0)
PY
```

Ten `ok` entries and an empty `errors` list: the documents are well formed and consistent, which is all you can honestly claim without a service.

### Step 17 - Search by annotation, read the service graph, and write the emitter

Search by annotation, read the derived service graph, then package today's telemetry into one script.

| Expression | Finds |
| --- | --- |
| `annotation.faculty = "science"` | traces annotated with that faculty |
| `annotation.transcript_bytes > 1000` | numeric comparison on an annotation |
| `service("usms-transcript-notifier")` | traces that touched that service |
| `responsetime > 1` | traces slower than a second |
| `service("usms-student-data") { fault }` | traces where **that specific service** faulted |

The last form answers "where did the bucket fail but not the function", which no single log line can.

**Command - part 1, search**

```bash
aws xray get-trace-summaries \
  --start-time "$XSTART" --end-time "$XEND" \
  --filter-expression 'annotation.faculty = "science"' \
  --query 'length(TraceSummaries)' --output text \
  || echo "filter expressions unsupported on this build"

aws xray get-trace-summaries \
  --start-time "$XSTART" --end-time "$XEND" \
  --filter-expression 'annotation.faculty = "engineering"' \
  --query 'length(TraceSummaries)' --output text \
  || echo "filter expressions unsupported on this build"
```

`1` then `0`. The second call proves the filter actually filters.

**Command - part 2, the service graph**

```bash
aws xray get-service-graph \
  --start-time "$XSTART" --end-time "$XEND" \
  --query 'Services[].{Name:Name,Type:Type,Edges:length(Edges),Ok:SummaryStatistics.OkCount}' \
  --output table | tee outputs/lab-13-service-graph.json
```

The graph is **derived** from traces, never declared: an edge exists because a subsegment with `namespace: aws` named a downstream service. An uninstrumented service therefore appears as a dead end, not a missing node.

**Expected result**

```text
---------------------------------------------------------------
|                      GetServiceGraph                        |
+----------------------------+---------------------+----+-----+
|  usms-transcript-notifier  |  AWS::Lambda::Function |  1 |  1 |
|  usms-student-data         |  AWS::S3::Bucket       |  0 |  1 |
+----------------------------+---------------------+----+-----+
```

> Example output - many builds return an empty `Services` list even when segments were accepted. If
> yours does, note it in the support probe; the graph is derived data and its absence does not

- Outer `<< 'EOF'` and inner `<< 'PY'` are both quoted so `$1`, `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` and `$(...)` run when the script runs, not now.
- `REPO_ROOT` resolves from the script's own location, so it works from any directory.
- `configs/lab-13.env` does not exist until Step 25; `|| true` and the `${VAR:-default}` fallbacks make the script work before and after.
- One `python3` call produces all four IDs and times so they describe the same instant.
- The three runs give Step 19 data: two engineering transcripts over two seconds.

```

> Example output - three blocks, one per invocation. A `trace SKIPPED` line is expected on a build
> without X-Ray and does not stop the script.

**Verify**

```bash

aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --filter-pattern 'USMS_EVENT' \
  --query 'length(events)' --output text
```

Four lines in the IDs file (Step 15 plus three emitter runs) and three more log events. The **same trace ID** appears in the log line, the IDs file and the segment: that is the join.

**Checkpoint 10**

```text
scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh

 ├── two metric data points  (TranscriptsProcessed, TranscriptLagSeconds)

```

### Step 18 - Decide what gets traced at all

A sampling rule decides centrally, without redeploying, how much gets traced.

!!! info "Reservoir plus rate"
    `ReservoirSize` traces that many requests **per second**, guaranteed; `FixedRate` then traces that fraction of the rest. The reservoir is a floor (a pure percentage misses low-volume incidents); the rate stops cost scaling with traffic. `Priority`: **lower number wins**, and every account has an undeletable `Default` rule at 10000. See [sampling](../unit7/topic1.md#sampling).

```bash
aws xray get-sampling-rules \
  --query 'SamplingRuleRecords[].SamplingRule.{Name:RuleName,Priority:Priority,Rate:FixedRate,Reservoir:ReservoirSize,Service:ServiceName}' \
  --output table

cat > templates/lab-13-sampling-rule.json << 'EOF'

  "ResourceARN": "*",
  "Priority": 1000,
  "FixedRate": 0.10,
  "ReservoirSize": 2,
  "ServiceName": "usms-transcript-notifier",
  "ServiceType": "*",
  "Host": "*",
  "HTTPMethod": "*",
  "URLPath": "*",
  "Version": 1
}
EOF

  --output table \
  || echo "create-sampling-rule unsupported on this build - the document above is the deliverable"
```

- Every field is **required**; a field you do not care about is `*`, not omitted. `"Version": 1` is the schema version, not something you increment.
- `Priority: 1000` beats the default. `FixedRate: 0.10` with `ReservoirSize: 2`: always trace the first two notifications each second, then one in ten of the rest.

**Expected result**

```

One row with priority 1000. If the create call failed, the JSON document is the assessable artefact (Section 13 asks for the document).

!!! note "Floci Limitation - sampling is never applied"
    Floci stores sampling rules where it supports the API, and nothing consumes them; the segments you send are sent unconditionally.

    On real AWS each instrumented process polls `GetSamplingRules` and `GetSamplingTargets`, so a rule change applies fleet-wide within seconds without a deployment.

    Take away the reservoir-plus-rate reasoning and the priority ordering, both checkable by reading the document.

---

### Step 19 - Create two alarms, one of which watches for an absence

Two alarms; the second, which detects silence, is the more valuable and the more often forgotten.

!!! info "Alarm states and missing data"
    An alarm is `OK`, `ALARM` or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` (not an error: the state new alarms start in, and where Lab 06's `usms-enrolment-queue-high` has been since Practical 4). `--treat-missing-data` is `missing` (default, keep current state), `notBreaching`, `breaching` or `ignore`. `TranscriptLagSeconds` has no data at 3am and that is normal, so `notBreaching`. For `NotifyCount` the absence **is** the problem, so `breaching`. **Every threshold alarm's blind spot is silence.** See [alarm states](../unit7/topic3.md#alarm-states) and [missing-data treatment](../unit7/topic3.md#missing-data-treatment).

**Command - part 1, the threshold alarm**

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --alarm-description "Transcript notification latency above 2s for 2 of 3 minutes" \
  --namespace USMS/Application \
  --metric-name TranscriptLagSeconds \
  --dimensions Name=Stage,Value=notify \
  --statistic Maximum \
  --period 60 \
  --evaluation-periods 3 \
  --datapoints-to-alarm 2 \
  --threshold 2 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --treat-missing-data notBreaching \
  --unit Seconds \
  --tags Key=Project,Value=USMS Key=Lab,Value=08
```

`put-metric-alarm` creates **or replaces**; there is no update, and omitting a flag you set last time removes that setting.

| Flag | Decides |
| --- | --- |
| `--period 60` | how wide each evaluation bucket is |
| `--statistic Maximum` | how the data points inside a bucket become one number |
| `--evaluation-periods 3` | how many buckets are examined |
| `--datapoints-to-alarm 2` | how many of those must breach |
| `--threshold 2` with `--comparison-operator` | what breaching means |

- 2 of 3 filters out a single slow transcript but catches a persistent problem within three minutes.
- `Maximum`, not `Average`: an average hides the one student who waited nine seconds.
- `--unit Seconds` must match the published unit, or the alarm sits in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` forever looking healthy.

**Command - part 2, the absence alarm**

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name usms-notify-silence \
  --alarm-description "No transcript notifications for 15 minutes - the pipeline has gone quiet" \
  --namespace USMS/Application \
  --metric-name NotifyCount \
  --statistic Sum \
  --period 300 \
  --evaluation-periods 3 \
  --datapoints-to-alarm 3 \
  --threshold 1 \
  --comparison-operator LessThanThreshold \
  --treat-missing-data breaching \
  --tags Key=Project,Value=USMS Key=Lab,Value=08
```

- Fewer than one notification per five-minute bucket, with empty buckets counting as breaching; three buckets is fifteen minutes of silence.
- No `--dimensions` and no `--unit`: Step 9's filter published neither, so adding them would match nothing (Step 11's diagram).
- Fifteen minutes is a judgement; transcripts are quiet all night, and Exercise 4 asks you to argue for a window.

**Expected result**

Neither call prints anything on success.

**Verify**

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms \
  --alarm-names usms-transcript-lag-high usms-notify-silence \
  --query 'MetricAlarms[].{Name:AlarmName,Metric:MetricName,Stat:Statistic,Th:Threshold,Op:ComparisonOperator,Missing:TreatMissingData,State:StateValue}' \
  --output table
```

Two rows, `Missing` reading `notBreaching` and `breaching` respectively: the point of the step in one column.

```text

|                                           DescribeAlarms                                             |

+---------------------------+----------------------+---------+-----+----------------------+-----+------+
```

> Example output - the `State` column depends on whether your build evaluates alarms at all, and
> `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` for both is the most likely answer. Step 20 is where that stops mattering.

---

### Step 20 - Prove the alarms, by making one fire

An alarm you have never seen change state is untested. This is the lab's second **create → perturb → read back**.

`aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state` forces a state with a reason; it does not change the metric, and real CloudWatch re-evaluates on the next period. On real AWS it tests what happens *after* the alarm (notification, runbook, action). On Floci it is the only way to see a transition, because alarms are not evaluated; Section 11 is explicit that evaluation is not proven.

**Command - part 1, force the transition**

```bash
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state \
  --alarm-name usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --state-value ALARM \
  --state-reason "Lab 13 Step 20: forced transition to prove the alarm is wired and records history" \
  --state-reason-data '{"lab":"08","step":20,"synthetic":true}'

sleep 2

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --query 'MetricAlarms[0].{State:StateValue,Reason:StateReason,Since:StateUpdatedTimestamp}' \
  --output json
```

- `--state-reason` is free text a human reads in the notification; say what you did and why, never just "test".
- `--state-reason-data` is machine-readable JSON; `"synthetic": true` lets an automated responder tell.

**Command - part 2, read the history**

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history \
  --alarm-name usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --history-item-type StateUpdate \
  --max-records 5 \
  --query 'sort_by(AlarmHistoryItems, &Timestamp)[].[Timestamp,HistorySummary]' \
  --output table \
  | tee outputs/lab-13-alarm-history.json
```

`--history-item-type StateUpdate` filters to state changes (the others are `ConfigurationUpdate` and `Action`). History is kept for **two weeks** and cannot be extended.

**Expected result**

```text
{
    "State": "ALARM",
    "Reason": "Lab 13 Step 20: forced transition to prove the alarm is wired and records history",
    "Since": "2026-09-17T04:58:11.204000+00:00"
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                 DescribeAlarmHistory                                   |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|  2026-09-17T04:52:03.118000+00:00 |  Alarm "usms-transcript-lag-high" created            |
|  2026-09-17T04:58:11.204000+00:00 |  Alarm updated from INSUFFICIENT_DATA to ALARM       |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
```

> Example output - your timestamps will differ, and the exact wording of `HistorySummary` varies
> between builds.

A row containing `to ALARM` is the proof; `describe-alarms` alone could not distinguish an alarm that transitions from one that cannot.

**Command - part 3, put it back**

```bash
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state \
  --alarm-name usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --state-value OK \
  --state-reason "Lab 13 Step 20: restoring state after the forced-transition proof"

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --query 'MetricAlarms[0].StateValue' --output text
```

`OK`. Leaving it in `ALARM` keeps Step 21's composite permanently firing and lets Section 8's verification pass for the wrong reason.

!!! note "Floci Limitation - alarms are stored and transitioned, never evaluated"
    Floci stores alarm configuration, accepts `set-alarm-state` and keeps history, but never evaluates alarms or invokes `--alarm-actions`.

    Real AWS evaluates every alarm each period, transitions it, writes history and invokes its actions (SNS, scaling, EC2, Systems Manager).

    The honest claim: the alarm is configured, addressable, transitions and records history. Whether the threshold is right needs reading against the metric's distribution, which is Exercise 3.

**Checkpoint 11**

```text
ALARMS
 ├── usms-transcript-lag-high   TranscriptLagSeconds Max > 2, 2 of 3 × 60s, missing=notBreaching
 │     └── PROVEN: INSUFFICIENT_DATA → ALARM → OK, with history recorded
 └── usms-notify-silence        NotifyCount Sum < 1, 3 of 3 × 300s, missing=BREACHING
       └── watches for an absence, which no threshold on a value can do
outputs/lab-13-alarm-history.json
```

---

### Step 21 - Combine them into one incident

Two alarms for one pipeline means two pages for one outage. A composite alarm watches other alarms instead of a metric.

```text
usms-transcript-lag-high  ──┐
                            ├──→ usms-transcript-pipeline-down   ← the one that notifies
usms-notify-silence     ────┘
```

!!! info "Composite alarms"
    The rule language is `ALARM`, `OK`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, `TRUE`/`FALSE` with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`. Two uses: **aggregation** (one incident, one page; children keep actions off) and **suppression** (`ALARM(service-down) AND NOT ALARM(deployment-in-progress)`, formalised by `--actions-suppressor`). See [composite alarms](../unit7/topic3.md#composite-alarms).

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-composite-alarm \
  --alarm-name usms-transcript-pipeline-down \
  --alarm-description "The USMS transcript pipeline is failing or silent. One incident, one page." \
  --alarm-rule 'ALARM("usms-transcript-lag-high") OR ALARM("usms-notify-silence")' \
  --actions-enabled \
  --tags Key=Project,Value=USMS Key=Lab,Value=08
```

- `--alarm-rule` is one string in **single** quotes with **double** quotes around each alarm name; both are required, or CloudWatch reports a parse error at a position you did not think you wrote.
- `--actions-enabled` (the default) marks this as the alarm that notifies; in production you would set `--no-actions-enabled` on both children once a future alerting lab gives them actions.
- No `--alarm-actions` yet: there is no SNS topic. Exercise 5 writes the draft a future alerting lab applies.

**Expected result**

Nothing on success.

**Verify**

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-types CompositeAlarm \
  --query 'CompositeAlarms[].{Name:AlarmName,Rule:AlarmRule,State:StateValue}' --output json

aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state \
  --alarm-name usms-notify-silence \
  --state-value ALARM \
  --state-reason "Lab 13 Step 21: driving a child alarm to observe the composite"

sleep 3

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names usms-transcript-pipeline-down \
  --alarm-types CompositeAlarm \
  --query 'CompositeAlarms[0].{State:StateValue,Reason:StateReason}' --output json

aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state \
  --alarm-name usms-notify-silence \
  --state-value OK \
  --state-reason "Lab 13 Step 21: restoring state"
```

- `--alarm-types CompositeAlarm` is required; without it `describe-alarms` returns metric alarms only.
- The middle commands are create → perturb → read back one level up: driving a **child** into `ALARM` should drive the **parent** there.

The rule string comes back exactly as written and, on a build that evaluates composites, the parent follows the child. If the parent stays `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, record it in the support probe; the rule is the artefact.

!!! danger "Read before running any delete command"
    **What will be deleted:** the two metric alarms and the composite alarm this lab created, if you
    run the cleanup script in Section 8.

    **What depends on it:** a future alerting lab (not yet written) attaches SNS actions to
    `usms-transcript-lag-high`, `usms-notify-silence` and `usms-transcript-pipeline-down` by name.

    **Reversible?** Yes - re-run Steps 19 and 21. Alarm **history** is not reversible and would be
    lost, and two weeks is all there ever was.

    **Effect on later labs:** a future alerting lab would have nothing to attach an action to and
    would have to create the alarms itself, which is not what it is about.

    Do not run the cleanup script now. Section 8 has it, marked.

---

### Step 22 - Build the dashboard

A dashboard makes "is the transcript system healthy" answerable in four seconds by someone who knows none of these API calls.

!!! info "A dashboard is a JSON document"
    `put-dashboard` takes a JSON body, so a dashboard is a text file that belongs in version control. The grid is **24 columns** wide; each widget has `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and overlaps are not resolved. Widget types: `metric` (time series, single value or gauge by `view`), `log`, `text` (markdown, e.g. a runbook link) and `alarm`. See [dashboard anatomy](../unit7/topic3.md#anatomy-of-a-dashboard).

```bash

        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
EOF

python3 -m json.tool templates/lab-13-dashboard.json > /dev/null && echo "valid JSON"

aws cloudwatch put-dashboard \
  --dashboard-name usms-overview \
  --dashboard-body file://templates/lab-13-dashboard.json \
  --query 'DashboardValidationMessages' --output json
```

- `<< 'EOF'`, quoted: nothing to expand, same rule as the other documents.
- Metric arrays are positional: `[ namespace, metricName, dimName, dimValue, ..., { options } ]`. `NotifyCount` has no dimensions (Step 9), as the Step 19 alarm had to respect.
- Per-metric `stat` draws two statistics of one metric on one chart; `annotations.horizontal` draws the alarm threshold.
- The `alarm` widget takes **ARNs**, with Floci's account hard-coded; Exercise 2 builds them from `$USMS_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- `DashboardValidationMessages`: a dashboard with a bad widget is **still created**; the widget just does not render.

**Expected result**

```text
valid JSON
[]
```

> Example output - an empty list means every widget validated.

**Verify**

```bash
aws cloudwatch list-dashboards \
  --query 'DashboardEntries[].[DashboardName,Size]' --output table

aws cloudwatch get-dashboard --dashboard-name usms-overview \
  --query 'DashboardBody' --output text \
  | python3 -c "
import json, sys
body = json.load(sys.stdin)
print('widgets     :', len(body['widgets']))
print('types       :', ', '.join(sorted({w['type'] for w in body['widgets']})))
print('grid width  :', max(w['x'] + w['width'] for w in body['widgets']))
rows = sorted((w['y'], w['y'] + w['height'], w['x'], w['x'] + w['width']) for w in body['widgets'])
overlap = any(a[1] > b[0] and a[3] > b[2] and b[3] > a[2] for a, b in zip(rows, rows[1:]))
print('overlapping :', overlap)
"
```

`get-dashboard` returns the body as a JSON string inside a JSON field (like `lambda get-policy` in Lab 10 Step 19); `--output text` unwraps it. The overlap check matters because an overlapping layout is valid JSON and produces no validation message.

**Expected result**

> Example output - your `Size` will differ.

!!! note "Floci Limitation - there is nothing to render a dashboard with"
    Floci stores and returns the document but has no console to draw it and validates nothing beyond its overall shape.

    Real AWS renders it, validates each widget into `DashboardValidationMessages`, and refreshes it live.

    The JSON is byte-for-byte what you would put to real AWS; treat the file in `templates/` as the artefact.

### Step 23 - Query the logs properly

`filter-log-events` finds lines; Logs Insights answers questions (counts, groupings, percentiles) retroactively over a whole group.

```text
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /USMS_EVENT/
| parse @message 'USMS_EVENT *' as payload
| stats count() as events by bin(5m)
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `fields` | choose columns. `@timestamp`, `@message`, `@logStream` are always available |
| `filter` | keep matching rows. Supports `like /regex/`, unlike a metric filter pattern |
| `parse` | extract fields with a glob or a regex |
| `stats` | aggregate - `count()`, `avg()`, `max()`, `pct(f, 99)` - optionally `by` something |
| `sort`, `limit` | the obvious |

!!! info "Insights versus metric filters"
    Insights `filter` takes a **regular expression**; Step 8's filter pattern language does not. A query is retroactive and billed per volume scanned each run; a metric filter is evaluated once at ingestion and free to read. **Put constant questions behind a metric filter; ask everything else with a query.** See [Logs Insights](../unit7/topic2.md#log-analysis-with-amazon-cloudwatch-logs-insights).

**Command - path A, if Step 4 reported Insights as SUPPORTED**

```bash
QUERY_ID=$(aws logs start-query \
  --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --start-time "$XSTART" --end-time "$XEND" \
  --query-string 'fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /USMS_EVENT/
| parse @message "*\"faculty\":\"*\"*" as pre, faculty, post
| stats count() as events by faculty
| sort events desc' \
  --query 'queryId' --output text)

echo "query: $QUERY_ID"

for attempt in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do
  STATUS=$(aws logs get-query-results --query-id "$QUERY_ID" --query 'status' --output text)
  [ "$STATUS" = "Complete" ] && break
  printf '  status %s, waiting\n' "$STATUS"
  sleep 3
done

aws logs get-query-results --query-id "$QUERY_ID" \
  --query 'results[].[ [0].value, [1].value ]' --output table
```

- `start-query` is **asynchronous**: poll `get-query-results` until `status` is `Complete` (others: `Scheduled`, `Running`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, `Timeout`). Reading once returns an empty list, not an error.
- Each result row is a list of `{field, value}` objects; `results[].[ [0].value, [1].value ]` flattens it positionally.

**Command - path B, if Insights is unsupported**

Answer the same question with the tool you have:

```bash
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name "$CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP" \
  --filter-pattern 'USMS_EVENT' \
  --query 'events[].message' --output text \

Retrieve, parse, aggregate on your machine: correct and portable, but every event crosses the network, the parsing is fragile, percentiles need writing, and it does not scale past a few thousand events.

**Expected result - either path**

```text
science        3
engineering    2
```

> Example output - your counts depend on how many times you ran the emitter in Step 17.

**Verify**

```bash
aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /usms/central \
  --query 'logGroups[0].{Group:logGroupName,Retention:retentionInDays,Bytes:storedBytes}' \
  --output json
```

Counts match your emitter runs, and `storedBytes` is not zero. Nothing returned from a group with bytes means the time window is stale: `XSTART` and `XEND` were computed in Step 16, so recompute them if the session has run long.

### Step 24 - Restart Floci and read everything back

Prove persistence. Telemetry adds a distinction: **configuration** (log groups, filters, alarms, dashboards) and time-indexed **data** (events, data points, segments) can persist differently, which makes a dashboard look healthy while empty.

**Command - part 1, record the state**

```bash
inventory() {
  echo "--- log groups ---"
  aws logs describe-log-groups \
    --query 'sort_by(logGroups, &logGroupName)[].[logGroupName,retentionInDays]' --output text
  echo "--- metric filters ---"
  aws logs describe-metric-filters \
    --query 'sort_by(metricFilters, &filterName)[].[filterName,logGroupName]' --output text
  echo "--- metrics ---"
  aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace USMS/Application \
    --query 'sort_by(Metrics, &MetricName)[].MetricName' --output text | tr '\t' '\n' | sort -u
  echo "--- alarms ---"
  aws cloudwatch describe-alarms \
    --query 'sort_by(MetricAlarms, &AlarmName)[].[AlarmName,StateValue]' --output text
  aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-types CompositeAlarm \
    --query 'sort_by(CompositeAlarms, &AlarmName)[].[AlarmName,AlarmRule]' --output text
  echo "--- dashboards ---"
  aws cloudwatch list-dashboards --query 'DashboardEntries[].DashboardName' --output text
  echo "--- notifier ---"
  aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name "$NOTIFIER" --qualifier live \
    --query '[Version,TracingConfig.Mode]' --output text
}

inventory | tee outputs/lab-13-pre-restart.txt

DATA_BEFORE=$(aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace USMS/Application --metric-name TranscriptsProcessed \
  --start-time "$START" --end-time "$END" --period 300 --statistics Sum \
  --query 'length(Datapoints)' --output text)

echo "metric data points before restart: $DATA_BEFORE"
```

**Command - part 2, perturb**

```bash
./scripts/setup/floci-down.sh
./scripts/setup/floci-up.sh
./scripts/utilities/whoami.sh
```

`floci-down.sh` is `docker compose stop`, which keeps state. It is not `docker compose down -v`, which would delete the volumes and the course.

**Command - part 3, read back**

```bash
source configs/course.env
for f in configs/lab-01.env configs/lab-10.env; do [ -f "$f" ] && source "$f"; done
NOTIFIER="${USMS_LAMBDA_NOTIFIER_FN:-usms-transcript-notifier}"
CENTRAL_LOG_GROUP=/usms/central/application

inventory | tee outputs/lab-13-post-restart.txt

diff outputs/lab-13-pre-restart.txt outputs/lab-13-post-restart.txt \
  && echo "CONFIGURATION IDENTICAL - every Lab 13 object survived the restart"

DATA_AFTER=$(aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace USMS/Application --metric-name TranscriptsProcessed \
  --start-time "$START" --end-time "$END" --period 300 --statistics Sum \
  --query 'length(Datapoints)' --output text)

printf 'metric data points: before=%s after=%s\n' "$DATA_BEFORE" "$DATA_AFTER"
```

- Re-sourcing and re-deriving `NOTIFIER` makes the read-back valid even if you closed the terminal (shell functions and variables die with it).
- `diff` compares configuration; the two `get-metric-statistics` calls compare **data**, separately.

**Expected result**

```text
--- log groups ---
/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier	14
/usms/central/application	30
/usms/ecs/enrolment	30
--- metric filters ---
usms-central-errors	/usms/central/application
usms-notify-count	/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier
--- metrics ---
CentralErrorCount
EdgeDenyCount
NotifyCount
TranscriptLagSeconds
TranscriptsProcessed
--- alarms ---
usms-enrolment-queue-high	INSUFFICIENT_DATA
usms-notify-silence	OK
usms-transcript-lag-high	OK
usms-transcript-pipeline-down	ALARM("usms-transcript-lag-high") OR ALARM("usms-notify-silence")
--- dashboards ---
usms-overview
--- notifier ---
3	Active

CONFIGURATION IDENTICAL - every Lab 13 object survived the restart
metric data points: before=2 after=2
```

> Example output - your counts differ, and `after=0` is a real and common result. Read the next
> paragraph before concluding anything from it.

Check, in this order:

1. `diff` reports no differences: configuration persisted.
2. The notifier still reports version `3` and `Active` (Steps 13 and 14 survived).
3. `before` and `after` match: data persisted. **If `after` is 0 and `before` was not, your build persists configuration and discards time-series data**, a real finding, not your error. Record it in `outputs/lab-13-support-probe.txt` and re-run `./scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh` twice so Section 8's verification has data.

A **configuration** difference is serious: run `./scripts/utilities/floci-storage-check.sh` before any more work. Storage mode `memory` is almost always the cause.

**Checkpoint 13**

### Step 25 - Write `configs/lab-13.env`

Turn this lab's shell variables into a file later labs can source.

```bash
cat > configs/lab-13.env << EOF
# Lab 13 - Centralized logging and monitoring with CloudWatch and X-Ray
# Generated on $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
# Contains names, ARNs and IDs only. NO SECRETS. Safe to commit.

  --order-by LastEventTime --descending --max-items 1 \
  --query 'logStreams[0].logStreamName' --output text | head -1)
export USMS_LOG_RETENTION_APP=30
export USMS_LOG_RETENTION_FN=14

# --- metric layer ---------------------------------------------------------
export USMS_METRIC_NAMESPACE=USMS/Application
export USMS_METRIC_FILTER_NOTIFY=usms-notify-count
export USMS_METRIC_FILTER_ERRORS=usms-central-errors
export USMS_METRIC_NOTIFY_COUNT=NotifyCount
export USMS_METRIC_ERROR_COUNT=CentralErrorCount
export USMS_METRIC_PROCESSED=TranscriptsProcessed
export USMS_METRIC_LAG=TranscriptLagSeconds
export USMS_METRIC_EDGE_DENY=EdgeDenyCount

# --- iam ------------------------------------------------------------------
export USMS_POLICY_OBSERVABILITY=USMSObservabilityWrite
export USMS_POLICY_OBSERVABILITY_ARN=$(aws iam list-policies --scope Local \
  --query "Policies[?PolicyName=='USMSObservabilityWrite'].Arn | [0]" --output text)

# --- the instrumented notifier -------------------------------------------
export USMS_NOTIFIER_VERSION_INSTRUMENTED=${NOTIFIER_V2}
export USMS_NOTIFIER_VERSION_TRACED=${NOTIFIER_V3}
export USMS_NOTIFIER_ALIAS_VERSION=$(aws lambda get-alias \
  --function-name usms-transcript-notifier --name live \
  --query 'FunctionVersion' --output text)
export USMS_NOTIFIER_TRACING_MODE=$(aws lambda get-function-configuration \
  --function-name usms-transcript-notifier --qualifier live \
  --query 'TracingConfig.Mode' --output text)

# --- alarms - a future alerting lab attaches SNS actions to these three ------------------
export USMS_ALARM_LAG_HIGH=usms-transcript-lag-high
export USMS_ALARM_NOTIFY_SILENCE=usms-notify-silence
export USMS_ALARM_COMPOSITE=usms-transcript-pipeline-down

# --- dashboard ------------------------------------------------------------
export USMS_DASHBOARD=usms-overview

# --- x-ray ----------------------------------------------------------------
export USMS_XRAY_SAMPLING_RULE=usms-transcripts-sampling
export USMS_XRAY_SUPPORTED=$(aws xray get-sampling-rules >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo yes || echo no)
export USMS_XRAY_LAST_TRACE_ID=$(awk 'END {print $1}' outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^1-' || echo none)

# --- capability flags recorded at lab time --------------------------------
export USMS_INSIGHTS_SUPPORTED=$(aws logs describe-queries --max-results 1 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo yes || echo no)
export USMS_TELEMETRY_EMITTER=scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh
EOF

cat configs/lab-13.env
```

`<< EOF`, **unquoted**: every `$(...)` must run now. Quoted, the file would hold command text, silently, with no error on write or source.

| Step | Form | Because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22 | `<< 'EOF'` / `<< 'PY'` | the file must contain exactly what you typed |
| 11 | `<< EOF` | one timestamp must be substituted |
| 25 | `<< EOF` | every value is the output of a command run now |

- `| head -1`: `--max-items 1` can emit a `NextToken` line on some builds, which would break the `export`.
- `| grep -E '^1-' || echo none`: Lab 06's sentinel pattern, so an empty result is an honest `none`, not a misleading `None`.
- The two capability flags record what your build supported at lab time, for later labs.

**Expected result**

```text
# Lab 13 - Centralized logging and monitoring with CloudWatch and X-Ray
# Generated on 2026-09-17T05:41:12Z
...
export USMS_NOTIFIER_ALIAS_VERSION=3
export USMS_NOTIFIER_TRACING_MODE=Active
...
export USMS_XRAY_SUPPORTED=yes
export USMS_XRAY_LAST_TRACE_ID=1-68ca5107-8b3e1d02f7a94c56e1d0b3a7
export USMS_INSIGHTS_SUPPORTED=no
```

> Example output - your capability flags depend on your build, and `no` is a perfectly good value.

**Verify**

```bash
grep -c '^export' configs/lab-13.env

grep -nE '^export [A-Z_]+=$|None' configs/lab-13.env || echo "all values populated"

( source configs/lab-13.env && echo "sources cleanly" )
```

**28** exports, `all values populated`, and `sources cleanly`. An empty value or `None` means a resource does not exist; lower-case `none` on the trace id is expected without X-Ray. The `( ... )` subshell keeps a broken file from damaging your current environment.

---

### Step 26 - Check what Git sees, and commit

Find out what does not belong in the repository before it is in the history.

**Command - part 1, look**

```bash
git status --short
```

**Expected result**

```text
?? configs/lab-13.env
?? labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/
?? policies/usms-observability-write-policy.json
?? project/
?? scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh
?? templates/lab-13-dashboard.json
?? templates/lab-13-metric-data.json
?? templates/lab-13-sampling-rule.json
?? templates/lab-13-segment-downstream.json
?? templates/lab-13-segment-parent.json
?? templates/lab-13-segment-subsegments.json
```

> Example output - ordering and the exact set depend on what you have done.

This is the check, not the commit:

- **No `outputs/` path appears**: not the zip, the trace ids or the probe output.
- **No `.env` other than `configs/lab-13.env`**: the root `.env` is generated by `floci-up.sh` and never committed.
- **No `__pycache__`** (Step 13's `py_compile` created one).
- **`project/` appears and is empty so far**; the project checkpoint appendix says what of it is committable.

```bash
git check-ignore -v outputs/lab-13-notifier-v2.zip
git check-ignore -v outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt
git ls-files outputs/
```

**Expected result**

```text
.gitignore:12:outputs/*	outputs/lab-13-notifier-v2.zip
.gitignore:12:outputs/*	outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt
outputs/.gitkeep
```

> Example output - your line number will differ.

`check-ignore` names the rule and line for each file, and `git ls-files outputs/` lists only `.gitkeep`: Lab 1's `outputs/*` plus `!outputs/.gitkeep` still holding (`outputs/` would make the negation silently do nothing).

**Command - part 2, commit**

```bash
git add configs/lab-13.env \
        labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray \
        policies/usms-observability-write-policy.json \
        scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh \
        scripts/utilities/verify-lab-13.sh \
        scripts/cleanup/lab-13-cleanup.sh \
        templates/lab-13-*.json

git status --short

git commit -m "Lab 13: centralized logging and monitoring with CloudWatch and X-Ray

- /usms/central/application created; retention set on every USMS log group
- usms-notify-count and usms-central-errors metric filters -> USMS/Application
- 5 metrics in USMS/Application, 2 from filters and 3 published directly
- USMSObservabilityWrite on usms-lambda-exec-role and usms-ec2-app-role
- usms-transcript-notifier v2 instrumented, v3 traced, alias live repointed
- usms-transcript-lag-high, usms-notify-silence, usms-transcript-pipeline-down
- usms-overview dashboard, 5 widgets
- X-Ray segments, subsegments, annotations and a sampling rule"
```

- Paths are named explicitly rather than `git add -A`, so you do not rely on the ignore rule being right.
- `verify-lab-13.sh` and `lab-13-cleanup.sh` are created in Section 8; if you have not reached it, add them in a second commit.
- `project/` is **not** listed; the project checkpoint appendix says what goes in it and when.

**Verify**

```bash
git log --oneline -1
git show --stat --oneline HEAD | head -20
```

The commit exists, and its file list contains no `outputs/` path and no `.zip`.

## 8. Verification

### 8.1 Build `scripts/utilities/verify-lab-13.sh`

Run at the end of this lab and at the start of the next. It checks that objects **exist**, that they are **configured** as this lab requires, and that the environment underneath is sound. Several checks are static substitutes for behaviour Floci does not implement: `usms-notify-silence` treats missing data as **breaching**, the alias has moved past Lab 10's version 1, and the X-Ray documents are internally consistent.

{% raw %}```bash
cat > scripts/utilities/verify-lab-13.sh << 'EOF'

> Example output - this is the target.

**The expected count is `PASS=49  FAIL=0`.**

- **Fix Environment failures first**; everything below them fails as a consequence.
- **Nothing depends on X-Ray or Insights support**: the X-Ray block reads the documents in `templates/`, which both paths of Steps 15 to 18 produce.

| `TranscriptsProcessed ALSO published with none` | Without the undimensioned publish there is no total (Step 11) |
| `no two widgets overlap` | Nothing in CloudWatch validates layout |

### 8.2 Build the end-of-course cleanup script

!!! danger "DO NOT RUN THIS NOW"
    **What will be deleted:** three alarms including the composite, the dashboard, both metric
    filters, the central log group **and every log event in it**, the retention policies on the other
    groups, the X-Ray sampling rule, and the `USMSObservabilityWrite` policy after detaching it from
    two roles.

    **What depends on it:** a future alerting lab (not yet written) attaches SNS actions to all three alarms by name, and publishes
    into the `USMS/Application` namespace.

    **Reversible?** Partly. The configuration can be recreated by re-running this lab. Log events,
    metric data points and alarm history cannot - alarm history is two weeks at most and deleting a
    log group deletes its contents immediately.

    **Effect on later labs:** total for Lab 09, which would have nothing to notify about. This script
    exists for the end of the course, when you are dismantling the environment deliberately.

    Note what it does **not** delete: the notifier's versions, the Lab 10 bucket notification, and
    `/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier` itself. Those belong to Lab 10 and `lab-10-cleanup.sh`
    owns them.

Write it now and do not run it:

```bash
cat > scripts/cleanup/lab-13-cleanup.sh << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# END-OF-COURSE CLEANUP for Lab 13. Deletes dependencies inside-out.
# DO NOT RUN while Lab 09 or anything after it still needs these alarms.
set -uo pipefail

REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
# shellcheck disable=SC1091
source "$REPO_ROOT/configs/course.env"

CENTRAL="${USMS_LOG_GROUP_CENTRAL:-/usms/central/application}"
FN_LOG="${USMS_LOG_GROUP_NOTIFIER:-/aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier}"

cat << 'WARN'
This will permanently delete:
  - usms-transcript-pipeline-down (composite), and its two child alarms
  - ALL alarm history for them, which is not recoverable
  - the usms-overview dashboard
  - the usms-notify-count and usms-central-errors metric filters
  - /usms/central/application AND EVERY LOG EVENT IN IT
  - the usms-transcripts-sampling X-Ray rule
  - USMSObservabilityWrite, after detaching it from two roles

A future alerting lab (not yet written) attaches SNS actions to those alarms by name.
Metric DATA already published into USMS/Application is not deleted by this
script and cannot be deleted at all - CloudWatch metrics expire, they are
never removed. That is worth knowing and is not a bug.

The order is the lesson:

- **The composite alarm first**: deleting a child a composite names leaves a composite that cannot evaluate. Delete the thing that points, then the thing pointed at.
- **Metric filters before the log group**: deleting the group removes them implicitly, but explicit order is the habit for groups you keep.
- **`delete-log-group` deletes events immediately**, with no confirmation or recycle bin; events that matter must already be streamed elsewhere (subscription filters, conceptual in Section 11).
- **You cannot delete a CloudWatch metric.** Metrics expire after fifteen months without data, so think about cardinality before the first `put-metric-data`.

## 10. Troubleshooting

!!! warning "Known issue on Floci 2.0.1"
    On Floci 2.0.1, metric filters, Logs Insights, X-Ray, composite alarms, alarm history and dashboards are unavailable. Diagnose first, then use the alternative in [Known Issues - Lab 13](known-issues.md#lab-13-monitoring). It states what the alternative does and does not prove.

### `put-log-events` succeeds and `filter-log-events` returns nothing

Almost always the timestamp: seconds instead of **milliseconds**, so events landed in 1970, outside the ingestion window.

```bash
aws logs put-log-events --log-group-name /usms/central/application \
  --log-stream-name "$STREAM" \
  --log-events "timestamp=$(python3 -c 'import time;print(int(time.time()*1000))'),message=probe" \
  --query 'rejectedLogEventsInfo'
```

A non-zero `tooOldLogEventEndIndex` is the diagnosis. If it is `null` and events still do not appear, check the group name; a typo creates nothing and finds nothing.

### `InvalidSequenceTokenException` on `put-log-events`

Your build enforces the pre-2023 behaviour. Fetch and pass the token (Step 7's tip), and record the substitution in `outputs/lab-13-support-probe.txt`.

### `get-metric-statistics` returns an empty `Datapoints` list

Check in this order:

```bash
# 1. does the metric exist at all, and with which dimensions?
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace USMS/Application --metric-name TranscriptLagSeconds

# 2. are you asking with the EXACT dimension set it was published with?
#    A subset matches nothing. So does a superset.

# 3. is your window right, and in the past?
#    A window ending in the future is legal and returns nothing for the future part.

# 4. does --unit match what was published?
```

Number two is the answer about three times in four: a metric's identity is namespace plus name plus the **complete** dimension set (Step 11).

### The metric filter produced nothing even though the log line is there

Test the pattern against the actual line:

```bash
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier \
  --query 'events[-1].message' --output text

aws logs test-metric-filter --filter-pattern 'USMS_NOTIFY' \
  --log-event-messages "$(aws logs filter-log-events \
      --log-group-name /aws/lambda/usms-transcript-notifier \
      --query 'events[-1].message' --output text)"
```

If `test-metric-filter` matches and the metric is still empty, your build stores filters without evaluating them (Step 10's limitation). Publish the metric by hand, record it, and continue.

### The alarm stays in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` no matter what

Expected on Floci. On real AWS, first rule out the three configuration causes:

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --query 'MetricAlarms[0].{Ns:Namespace,Metric:MetricName,Dims:Dimensions,Unit:Unit,Period:Period}'
```

A `Unit` never published, a non-matching dimension set, or a period finer than the publishing interval each give a permanently uncertain alarm that looks correctly configured.

### `put-composite-alarm` fails with a parse error

The rule is one string with double-quoted alarm names, so single quotes outside:

```bash
--alarm-rule 'ALARM("usms-transcript-lag-high") OR ALARM("usms-notify-silence")'
```

Double quotes outside let the shell strip the inner ones. It also fails if a named child does not exist; composites validate children at creation.

### `describe-alarms` does not show the composite alarm

It is not missing. `describe-alarms` returns metric alarms unless you ask:

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-types CompositeAlarm
```

### `put-trace-segments` returns entries in `UnprocessedTraceSegments`

Read the `Message` field:

```bash
aws xray put-trace-segments --trace-segment-documents "$(cat templates/lab-13-segment-parent.json)" \
  --query 'UnprocessedTraceSegments[].[Id,ErrorCode,Message]' --output text
```

| Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `trace_id` not `1-<8hex>-<24hex>` | regenerate with the Step 15 Python block |
| `id` not exactly 16 hex characters | same |
| `end_time` missing or before `start_time` | check the arithmetic; X-Ray wants epoch **seconds as a float** |
| the embedded timestamp is too old | you cannot back-fill traces; generate a fresh trace id |
| an annotation whose value is a list or an object | annotations take string, number and boolean only - move it to metadata |

### `get-trace-summaries` returns nothing but `put-trace-segments` said `[]`

Your build stores segments without indexing them. Try `batch-get-traces` on an id from `outputs/lab-13-trace-ids.txt`; if that works, use it and record the finding. If neither works, take Step 16's structural-validation path.

### `start-query` returns a query id and the results are always empty

`start-query` is asynchronous; poll `get-query-results` until `status` is `Complete` (Step 23's loop). A `Failed` status means a query syntax error, reported there rather than in `start-query`.

### The dashboard was created but a widget is missing

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard --dashboard-name usms-overview \
  --dashboard-body file://templates/lab-13-dashboard.json \
  --query 'DashboardValidationMessages'
```

The messages are the only place an invalid widget is reported. An empty list with a widget still missing means it is drawn under another one; run Step 22's overlap check.

### `verify-lab-13.sh` reports `configs/lab-13.env has 28 exports` as a failure

Count them and find the missing one:

```bash
grep -c '^export' configs/lab-13.env
grep -nE '^export [A-Z_]+=$' configs/lab-13.env
```

An empty export means its source was empty when the heredoc ran, usually a shell variable from a closed terminal. `USMS_NOTIFIER_VERSION_INSTRUMENTED` and `USMS_NOTIFIER_VERSION_TRACED` are the likely ones. Re-derive them:

```bash
aws lambda list-versions-by-function --function-name usms-transcript-notifier \
  --query "Versions[?Version!='\$LATEST'].[Version,Description]" --output table
```

### Everything worked yesterday and nothing works today

```bash
./scripts/utilities/floci-storage-check.sh
```

`FAIL` in the shell block means a new terminal lost the course environment (Errata 01). `FAIL` on storage mode means Floci ran in `memory` mode and yesterday's work is gone; fix the compose file. If only the **metric data** is gone, that is Step 24's finding: re-run `./scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh` a few times and note it.

## 11. Floci vs Real AWS

| Feature | Real AWS | Floci | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create-log-group`, `put-retention-policy` | Full lifecycle; retention enforced by deletion | Works; retention stored, expiry not enforced | **Implemented in Floci** |
| `create-log-stream`, `put-log-events` | Ingests, orders, indexes | Works; ordering and the rejection report behave correctly | **Implemented in Floci** |
| `filter-log-events`, `describe-log-streams` | Searches across streams | Works | **Implemented in Floci** |
| `test-metric-filter` | Evaluates a pattern against sample messages | Works, and is a pure function - no state involved | **Implemented in Floci** |
| `put-metric-filter` stored and retrievable | Yes | Yes | **Implemented in Floci** |
| Metric filter **evaluated on ingestion** | Every event, within seconds | Build-dependent; frequently not evaluated at all | **Floci Limitation** |
| `put-metric-data`, `list-metrics`, `get-metric-statistics` | Full | Works for custom metrics | **Implemented in Floci** |
| AWS-published metrics (`AWS/Lambda`, `AWS/ECS`, `AWS/ApplicationELB`, `AWS/EC2`) | Thousands, free, automatic | Few or none | **Floci Limitation** |
| `put-metric-alarm`, `describe-alarms`, `set-alarm-state`, alarm history | Full | Stored, transitionable, history kept | **Implemented in Floci** |
| Alarm **evaluation** against metric data | Once per period, automatically | Not performed - alarms never move on their own | **Floci Limitation** |
| Alarm **actions** (`--alarm-actions`) | SNS, auto scaling, EC2, Systems Manager | Accepted and never invoked | **Floci Limitation** |
| `put-composite-alarm`, rule storage | Full, with actions suppression | Stored; rule evaluation build-dependent | **Floci Limitation** |
| `put-dashboard`, `get-dashboard` | Stored, validated per widget, rendered | Stored and returned; nothing renders it | **Floci Limitation** |
| Logs Insights `start-query` / `get-query-results` | Full query language, server-side aggregation | Frequently absent | **Floci Limitation** |
| `xray put-trace-segments` | Indexed within seconds, merged by trace id | Build-dependent: full, storage-only, or absent | **Floci Limitation** |
| `xray get-trace-summaries` with filter expressions | Full expression language | Build-dependent; often returns everything or nothing | **Floci Limitation** |
| `xray get-service-graph` | Derived from segments, with edge statistics | Frequently empty even when segments were accepted | **Floci Limitation** |
| `xray create-sampling-rule` | Stored and polled by every instrumented process | Stored at best; never consumed | **Floci Limitation** |
| Lambda `TracingConfig Mode=Active` | Starts a segment per sampled invocation, records init as a subsegment | Configuration stored; no daemon, no segment, `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` often absent | **Floci Limitation** |
| Automatic subsegments from an instrumented SDK | Every AWS call and HTTP call, with no code change | Absent | **Conceptual / Real AWS** |
| CloudWatch agent on EC2 (memory, disk, custom logs) | Installed and configured on the instance | No agent, and `usms-web-01` is not a real VM | **Conceptual / Real AWS** |
| Container Insights, Lambda Insights | Managed, per-cluster and per-function performance metrics | Absent | **Conceptual / Real AWS** |
| Metric math, anomaly detection alarms | Full | Absent | **Conceptual / Real AWS** |
| Log group subscription filters to Kinesis or Firehose | Streams every event out in real time | Absent | **Conceptual / Real AWS** |
| Cross-account observability, CloudWatch Logs encryption with KMS | Available | Absent | **Conceptual / Real AWS** |
| Cost: per GB ingested, per metric, per alarm, per trace, per GB scanned by a query | Real, and the largest single driver of AWS observability bills | Free | **Conceptual / Real AWS** |

In your report, separate what you **observed** (log groups, retention, events with millisecond timestamps, filters tested and attached, metrics with and without dimensions, the alias repointed, a forced alarm transition with history, the composite rule, the dashboard document, hand-built segments merged by trace id, all surviving a restart) from what you only **recorded** (filters firing on ingestion, alarms evaluating and notifying, sampling consumed, active tracing producing segments, IAM enforced) and what is **not available** (AWS-published metrics, a rendered dashboard, the CloudWatch agent, Container and Lambda Insights, metric math, anomaly detection, subscription filters, cost).

**Where Floci is nicer than reality (traps on real AWS):** everything is free (real CloudWatch bills per GB ingested, per custom metric, per alarm, per dashboard beyond three and per GB an Insights query scans, and X-Ray per trace; high-cardinality dimensions, groups without retention and month-long `@message` queries are each a large number, so this lab's teaching choices are also the cost choices); alarms never fire spuriously (a threshold set from five minutes of data will page someone in week three, and `--datapoints-to-alarm` is the dial you tune); metrics appear instantly (real ones take a minute or two, and new alarms sit in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` for their first periods); nothing is throttled (`PutMetricData` and `PutLogEvents` limits show up as *missing telemetry*); retention is never applied (on real AWS Step 6's 14 days is when incident evidence disappears, which Exercise 4 asks you to weigh); trace ids are never propagated for you (a service that drops the header cuts every trace in half).

!!! note "Floci Limitation - the one that shapes this whole lab"
    Floci stores observability configuration faithfully and evaluates almost none of it: filters may not fire, alarms do not evaluate, actions do not invoke, sampling is not consumed, dashboards are never drawn.

    Real AWS does all of that continuously, and that evaluation is the product.

    This lab gives you every document and configuration, built deliberately and checked by reading: tested filter patterns, justified missing-data policies, the composite rule, dashboard layout, segment structure, sampling reservoir. What it cannot show is that your thresholds are the right numbers; those come from data.

## 12. Independent Lab Exercises

Record commands and outputs in `labs/lab-13-cloudwatch-xray/exercises.md`; several exercises also ask for a file in `outputs/`.

### Exercise 1 - Basic: extract a value instead of counting events

**Requirements**

Add a third metric filter, `usms-transcript-seconds`, on `/usms/central/application`, publishing `TranscriptSecondsFromLogs` into `USMS/Application` from the **value extracted from the log line** (the `seconds` field in the `USMS_EVENT` lines from Step 7 and `usms-emit-telemetry.sh`), not a constant.

**Constraints**

- Run `test-metric-filter` first and include its output in your exercises file.
- Do not modify the existing `usms-central-errors` filter or its metric.
- The `USMS_EVENT ` prefix makes the JSON filter dialect unavailable. Use the text dialect's positional extraction, or change what the emitter writes; say which and what it cost.

**Expected outcome**

```text
Expected result:
A filter whose metricValue is an extracted field rather than 1.
Fresh emitter runs producing TranscriptSecondsFromLogs data points whose values
match the seconds you passed on the command line.
A paragraph on why this metric and Step 11's TranscriptLagSeconds measure the same
thing by two different routes, and which you would keep.
```

**Hints**

- Step 8's table has both dialects. The JSON one needs the whole message to be JSON.
- `metricValue` accepts `$1`, `$2` for positional tokens in the text dialect and `$.field` in the JSON one.
- `scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh` is yours to change.

---

### Exercise 2 - Intermediate: make the dashboard portable and add a widget

**Requirements**

Rewrite `templates/lab-13-dashboard.json` so it is generated from `USMS_ACCOUNT_ID` (`configs/lab-01.env`) and `AWS_REGION_COURSE` (`configs/course.env`) instead of literals. Add a sixth widget showing `CentralErrorCount` over the last three hours with the alarm threshold annotated, and re-`put` the dashboard.

**Constraints**

- The generator must be a re-runnable command sequence or a small script, not hand-editing.
- `put-dashboard` must return an empty `DashboardValidationMessages`.
- The overlap check from Step 22's verify must still pass with six widgets.
- `verify-lab-13.sh` checks for **5** widgets; update it and say why a hard-coded count is both useful and annoying.

**Expected outcome**

```text
Expected result:
A generated dashboard document containing no literal account id.
Six widgets, no overlaps, no validation messages.
verify-lab-13.sh back to FAIL=0 after your edit.
```

**Hints**

- Step 25's unquoted heredoc is the shape for a generator: the file contains values, not commands.
- Widget positions are grid units in a 24-column grid; the existing widgets end at `y=12`.
- A `metric` widget's `annotations.horizontal` is what draws the threshold line.

---

### Exercise 3 - Problem solving: are these thresholds defensible?

**Requirements**

Write `scripts/utilities/usms-threshold-report.sh` which, for every alarm whose name begins `usms-`, emits one JSON document to stdout with: alarm name, namespace, metric, statistic, period, evaluation periods, datapoints to alarm, threshold, comparison operator and missing-data policy, plus the **observed** minimum, average, maximum and sample count of its metric over the last 24 hours and a boolean `threshold_ever_breached`.

**Constraints**

- Valid JSON on stdout and nothing else; diagnostics go to stderr.
- Must run correctly from any directory.
- Must not fail under `set -u` when an alarm has no dimensions, or when a metric has no data.
- Do not hard-code the alarm list, and do not hard-code the metric names.
- A composite alarm has no metric. Handle it rather than crashing on it.

**Expected outcome**

```text
Expected shape:
[
  { "alarm": "usms-transcript-lag-high", "metric": "TranscriptLagSeconds",
    "statistic": "Maximum", "threshold": 2.0, "operator": "GreaterThanThreshold",
    "missing_data": "notBreaching",
    "observed": { "min": 0.31, "avg": 1.22, "max": 3.10, "samples": 7 },
    "threshold_ever_breached": true },
  ...
]
```

Three or four objects, one the composite with nulls where a metric would be, and at least one alarm whose threshold has **never** been approached: the finding the exercise exists to produce.

**Hints**

- `describe-alarms` returns almost every configuration field you need in one call.
- `get-metric-statistics` needs the exact dimension set from the alarm; pass it through.
- Build the JSON in `python3`, not by bash string concatenation.
- `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` is how the other scripts in this repository find the root.

---

### Exercise 4 - Challenge: design the USMS observability plan

The registrar's office brings four complaints and no design:

> Nobody noticed for six hours that transcripts had stopped being delivered - the dashboard was all
> green because the graphs were empty. When we finally did notice, we could not tell whether it was
> the upload, the function or the bucket. The audit office then asked us who had downloaded a
> particular transcript in March and we could not answer, because the logs were gone. And our AWS
> bill for monitoring is now larger than our bill for the thing being monitored.

**Requirements**

Write `notes/lab-13-observability-plan.md` (two to three pages) that:

1. For each complaint, names the right layer (logs, metrics, traces) and why the other two are not.
2. Proposes a USMS log group taxonomy with retention per group, justifying the longest and shortest. At least one group exists solely for the audit question; say who may read it.
3. Defines three **service level indicators** for transcript delivery with targets, saying which you would alarm on and which only graph, and why an un-alarmed SLI is not wasted.
4. Names every alarm with its missing-data policy, identifies the one that would have caught the six-hour outage, and explains why a threshold alarm on a value could not.
5. Estimates, in order of magnitude, where the monitoring bill goes, names the two changes with the largest effect, and states the cardinality of every proposed dimension.
6. Names one thing you would **not** build yet, and the observation that would change your mind.

**Constraints**

- No commands. This is a design document.
- Every AWS feature you name must exist; if unsure, say what you would verify and how.
- State at least one thing you would measure before committing to the design.
- Every number (threshold, retention, SLO target) says where it came from. "It seemed reasonable" is acceptable stated honestly, not left implicit.

**Expected outcome**

A document a colleague could implement from, in which the interesting paragraphs are the trade-offs rather than the feature list. There is more than one defensible answer to point 3; there is only one defensible attitude to point 6.

**Hints**

- Point 1's second complaint is the one with only one right answer, and this lab built it.
- Point 4 is Step 19's `--treat-missing-data` argument, applied to a real incident.
- Point 5: reread the cost point under "Where Floci is nicer than reality" in Section 11 and Step 11's paragraph on cardinality.
- An SLI is something a student would notice. "CPU utilisation" is not one.

---

### Exercise 5 - Integration: leave an alarm the next alerting lab can attach to

A future SNS/SQS integration lab will first give these alarms somewhere to notify. It needs to know which alarms exist, what they mean and what the action document should look like.

**Requirements**

1. Write `outputs/lab-13-alarm-actions-draft.json` describing, for each of this lab's three alarms, the action you would attach: the alarm name, its meaning, the urgency (page or ticket), and a placeholder ARN `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:<account>:usms-<topic>` using the real account id from `configs/lab-01.env`, not a literal.
2. Validate it: every alarm name must exist and every placeholder ARN must be well formed. Report mismatches; do not fix them silently.
3. **Do not apply it.** `put-metric-alarm --alarm-actions` is a replace operation, and a partial definition would silently drop Step 19's configuration.
4. Run `./scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh` at least five times with mixed faculties and latencies, then capture `get-metric-statistics` for `TranscriptLagSeconds` over the session into `outputs/lab-13-latency-baseline.json`, so the future notification threshold is argued from data.
5. Write `outputs/lab-13-alerting-readiness.txt` with: the three alarm names and missing-data policies; the composite rule; the namespace and five metric names; the notifier's alias version and tracing mode; X-Ray and Insights support on your build; the result of point 2; and the observed maximum latency from point 4.

**Constraints**

- `outputs/lab-13-alerting-readiness.txt` must be generated by a re-runnable command sequence, not typed.
- It contains no secret but stays in `outputs/`; confirm with `git check-ignore -v`.
- The draft must remain unapplied. Verify with
  `aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names usms-transcript-lag-high --query 'MetricAlarms[0].AlarmActions'`,
  which must return an empty list.

**Expected outcome**

```text
Expected result:
- outputs/lab-13-alarm-actions-draft.json exists, names three existing alarms, no literal account id
- AlarmActions on all three alarms is still []  - correct, a future alerting lab applies them
- outputs/lab-13-latency-baseline.json holds real observations, not invented numbers
- outputs/lab-13-alerting-readiness.txt exists, is git-ignored, and is reproducible
- verify-lab-13.sh still reports PASS=49  FAIL=0
```

**Hints**

- Lab 10 Exercise 5 built `outputs/lab-10-lab07-readiness.txt` the same way.
- `aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names A B C` takes several names at once, so point 2 is one call.
- A `{ ...; } | tee file` grouping captures a multi-command report in one file.
- A well-formed SNS ARN has six colon-separated fields; check it with `python3` and a regex.

### 13.1 In-class practical assessment

75 minutes, 100 marks. Open notes, open documentation. Your own repository only.

**Task A - build (30 marks).** Create a fourth alarm, `usms-edge-deny-spike`, on `EdgeDenyCount` with `Stage=viewer-request`, firing when more than 20 denials occur in five minutes across two consecutive periods. Choose and justify its `--treat-missing-data`. Then add it as a third child of `usms-transcript-pipeline-down`, first considering whether that is the right place. Marks: alarm correctly configured (10), missing-data choice justified in writing (10), composite rule updated correctly **or** a written argument for keeping it out (10).

**Task B - diagnose (25 marks).** What is wrong, and how would you confirm it?

> A colleague's alarm has been in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` for three days. The metric definitely has
> data - they can see it in `list-metrics`. Their alarm specifies namespace `USMS/Application`,
> metric `TranscriptLagSeconds`, statistic `Average`, period 60, `--unit Milliseconds`, and no
> dimensions. The metric is published by `usms-emit-telemetry.sh`.

Name the three distinct reasons the alarm cannot evaluate and one command per reason that would have caught it. Marks: three faults (15), three commands that genuinely detect them (10).

**Task C - explain (25 marks).** In at most 300 words in `outputs/lab-13-assessment-c.md`: a student identifier could go in a metric dimension, a log field or an X-Ray annotation. Explain what happens in each at thirty thousand students, where it belongs and why, using the word cardinality correctly and saying what each tool would cost.

**Task D - verify (20 marks).** Capture `./scripts/utilities/verify-lab-13.sh` output to `outputs/lab-13-assessment-d.txt`. Change one alarm's `--treat-missing-data` to `missing`, re-run, and write one sentence naming the check that caught you and one describing the production incident it prevents. Restore the configuration. Marks: `FAIL=0` before and after (10), the break-and-catch narrative (10).

---

## 14. Review Questions

Answer in prose in `notes/lab-13-notes.md`. No command output.

**1.** A colleague says "we have logs, so we do not need metrics". Give the two strongest technical arguments against, in terms of what each is cheap and expensive to do, and the one situation in which they are right.

**2.** Step 9 created a metric filter and Step 11 published a metric directly. Compare them on retroactivity, cost, what must change to add a measurement, and what happens when the emitting code is not yours. Which would you use for "how many transcript downloads happened" and which for "how long the render took", and why do the answers differ?

**3.** `usms-transcript-lag-high` treats missing data as `notBreaching` and `usms-notify-silence` as `breaching`. Explain why each setting would be wrong on the other alarm, describe one incident the second catches and the first cannot, and say what the dashboard would have looked like during it.

**4.** Distinguish a **metric dimension** from an **X-Ray annotation**: what each is indexed for, what happens as distinct values grow, and what you can ask of each. Then place each of these, with a sentence of justification: the transcript's faculty; the student's id; the origin's HTTP status; the name of the renderer that produced the PDF.

**5.** Step 13 published version 2 and repointed an alias; Step 14 published version 3 for only a configuration change. Why did that change need its own version, and what would have happened if you changed `TracingConfig` and left the alias on version 2? Relate it to Lab 10 Step 11's claim that a version freezes code and configuration.

**6.** Step 20 forced an alarm into `ALARM`. What does that prove and not prove? What would an equivalent test prove on real AWS that it cannot here, and why test what happens *after* an alarm fires even when confident in the threshold? Relate it to the rule that a command appearing to succeed is not evidence it did what you meant.

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝    ╚═══════════════════════════════════╝
```

Two checks before you finish. If you did the Step 13 Your-turn, confirm `live` points **forward** again, not at version 1:

```bash
aws lambda get-alias --function-name usms-transcript-notifier --name live \
  --query 'FunctionVersion' --output text
```

And confirm neither alarm was left in the state you forced it into:

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names usms-transcript-lag-high usms-notify-silence \
  --query 'MetricAlarms[].[AlarmName,StateValue]' --output text
```

Both are checked by `verify-lab-13.sh`. Do not run `scripts/cleanup/lab-13-cleanup.sh` (Section 8.2) until the end of the course.

## 16. Preparation for the Next Lab

No Lab 14 is written yet. The natural next lab is an SNS/SQS integration lab that gives the notifier somewhere to notify: since Lab 10 Step 17 its `notify()` docstring has said *Later: sns.publish(...)*, and three alarms now exist with no actions.

| Artefact | From | How it will use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `USMS_ALARM_LAG_HIGH`, `USMS_ALARM_NOTIFY_SILENCE`, `USMS_ALARM_COMPOSITE` | `configs/lab-13.env` | Attaches `--alarm-actions` to the composite and `--no-actions-enabled` to the children |
| `outputs/lab-13-alarm-actions-draft.json` | Exercise 5 | **Applies** it - the step this lab deliberately did not take |
| `outputs/lab-13-latency-baseline.json` | Exercise 5 | Argues the notification threshold from observed data rather than inventing one |
| `USMS/Application` and its five metrics | Step 9, Step 11 | Publishes a queue-depth metric into the same namespace, and adds it to `usms-overview` |
| `usms-overview` | Step 22 | Adds widgets to the existing dashboard rather than creating a second one |
| `usms-transcript-notifier` v3 and alias `live` | Steps 13, 14 | Publishes v4 with a real `sns.publish` in `notify()` and repoints the alias - the second time this session's alias mechanism earns its keep |
| `USMSObservabilityWrite` | Step 12 | The pattern to copy for `USMSMessagingWrite`; the observability policy itself grows by nothing |
| `/usms/central/application` | Step 6 | Where the SQS consumer writes, so that one filter already counts it |
| `usms-lambda-exec-role` | Lab 01 | Gets one more policy, still without editing `USMSLambdaBasic` |

!!! warning "`put-metric-alarm` replaces the alarm"
    Adding `--alarm-actions` with only the name, metric and action reverts `Maximum`, the 2-of-3 evaluation and `notBreaching` to defaults. The sequence must be describe, merge, put. The same applies to `put-composite-alarm`, `put-dashboard`, `put-bucket-notification-configuration`, `put-bucket-policy`, `update-assume-role-policy` and `update-function-configuration`: **each will delete what you did not mention and still return success**.

**Before the next session, confirm all five:**

```bash
cd ~/aws-floci-course
source configs/course.env

./scripts/utilities/verify-lab-10.sh | tail -2          # PASS=51  FAIL=0
./scripts/utilities/verify-lab-13.sh | tail -2          # PASS=49  FAIL=0
grep -c '^export' configs/lab-13.env                    # 28
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names usms-transcript-lag-high \
  --query 'MetricAlarms[0].AlarmActions' --output json  # []  - correct, unfilled until that future lab
aws lambda get-alias --function-name usms-transcript-notifier --name live \
  --query 'FunctionVersion' --output text               # 3, or higher
```

If `verify-lab-10.sh` now fails, this lab broke the alias, almost certainly a Step 13 Your-turn rollback never rolled forward. Fix it before the next session.

Finally, take a snapshot:

```bash
floci snapshot save lab-13-complete
floci snapshot list
```

If `floci snapshot` is not available on your build, use the filesystem fallback - and stop Floci
first, because archiving a live data directory can capture a half-written file:

```bash

## Appendix - New CLI and JMESPath patterns

Everything here is new to the course at Lab 13. Patterns from Labs 1 to 6 are assumed and are not
repeated.

**Shorthand argument syntax**

| Pattern | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--metric-data 'MetricName=M,Unit=U,Value=V,Dimensions=[{Name=N,Value=V}]'` | A list of structures containing a nested list of structures - the deepest the CLI shorthand goes |
| `--metric-transformations metricName=M,metricNamespace=N,metricValue=1,defaultValue=0` | Lower-camel keys, unlike most shorthand in this course. `defaultValue` is what makes a gap a zero |
| `--tags Key=Project,Value=USMS Key=Lab,Value=08` | CloudWatch alarms take **space-separated** `Key=`/`Value=` pairs - a fourth tagging syntax after Lambda's, S3's and EC2's |
| `--tracing-config Mode=Active` | A one-key structure |
| `--dimensions Name=Stage,Value=notify` | Must match the published set **exactly**; a subset matches nothing |

**Parameter and time handling**

| Pattern | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp=<epoch ms>` in `--log-events` | CloudWatch Logs takes **milliseconds as an integer** |
| `"start_time": <epoch seconds as float>` in a segment | X-Ray takes **seconds as a float**. Two services, two units, no warning either way |
| `--start-time`/`--end-time` as ISO-8601 (`cloudwatch`) or epoch seconds (`xray`) | Also different between the two services |
| `WINDOW=$(python3 -c '...'); START=${WINDOW% *}; END=${WINDOW#* }` | Both ends of a time window from one process, split with parameter expansion |
| `date -u -d '-5 minutes' \|\| date -u -v-5M` | GNU and BSD date, in that order. This lab then stops using `date` for arithmetic entirely |

**JMESPath**

| Pattern | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `logGroups[?logGroupName=='X'] \| length(@)` | Filter, then apply a function through a pipe - turns a prefix match into an exact one |
| `logGroups[?retentionInDays==null].logGroupName` | Filter on a field being **absent**. The comparison is against `null`, not against the string `None` |
| `keys(Annotations)` | An object's key names, without their values |
| `join(`,`, Dimensions[].Name) \|\| `NONE`` | Flatten a list to a string, with a literal fallback when it is empty |
| `Metrics[].join(`,`, Dimensions[].Name)` | A function applied inside a projection |
| `results[].[ [0].value, [1].value ]` | Positional navigation of Insights results, which are lists of `{field, value}` rather than objects |
| `MetricAlarms[0].StateValue` built as `"MetricAlarms[0].$2"` in a shell function | Composing a query string from a parameter, to avoid repeating a command five times |

**Response fields that report partial failure on a successful call**

This lab has four of them, and recognising the category is worth more than memorising the list.

| Field | Returned by | Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rejectedLogEventsInfo` | `put-log-events` | Some events were outside the ingestion window |
| `UnprocessedTraceSegments` | `put-trace-segments` | Some segment documents were malformed |
| `DashboardValidationMessages` | `put-dashboard` | The dashboard was created; some widgets will not render |
| (silence) | `put-metric-data` | Nothing is returned at all - the only check is reading the metric back |

**Shell**

| Pattern | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `( source configs/lab-13.env && echo ok )` | Source in a subshell so a broken file cannot damage your environment |
| `set_retention() { ... }` over a list of possibly-absent resources | A function reporting `absent, skipped` beats a loop that aborts or a silent `\|\| true` |
| `\| head -1` after a paginated `--max-items 1` | Stops a `NextToken` line becoming part of an `export` value |
| `\| grep -E '^1-' \|\| echo none` | Turn a `None` into an honest sentinel before it reaches a config file |
| `cmd --query 'Field' --output text \| python3 -c ...` | For fields that contain JSON **as a string** - `get-dashboard` and `lambda get-policy` both do this |

**Concepts with no command**

| Idea | Where it appeared |
| --- | --- |
| Log group as a unit of retention and access control, not of component | Step 6 |
| A marker string becoming an interface once a filter depends on it | Step 7, Step 9 |
| Filter patterns are not regular expressions; Insights `filter` is | Steps 8, 23 |
| A metric's identity is namespace + name + the complete dimension set | Step 11 |
| Cardinality is cost, and where a high-cardinality value belongs instead | Steps 11, 15 |
| Add a policy per concern rather than editing a shared one; the five-version cap | Step 12 |
| `PassThrough` versus `Active`: who owns the sampling decision | Step 14 |
| Trace, segment, subsegment, and `namespace` deriving the service graph | Steps 15, 16, 17 |
| Annotation versus metadata: indexed and searchable, or neither | Steps 15, 17 |
| Reservoir plus rate, and rule priority | Step 18 |
| Missing data as a first-class alarm decision; alarming on an absence | Step 19 |
| Forcing a state transition to test what happens after the alarm | Step 20 |
| Composite alarms for aggregation and for suppression | Step 21 |
| A dashboard is a document, and belongs in version control | Step 22 |
| Replace-only APIs, now a named category of seven | Section 16 |

## Appendix - Project Implementation Checkpoint 1

The first assessed submission of the individual project: the first point at which your system can be **demonstrated** rather than listed. The full brief (scope, rubric, demonstration protocol, submission) is `docs/Lab/project-checkpoint-01.md`; this is the part that lives in your repository.

### 1. What the checkpoint asks for, in one paragraph

Show that your partial USMS is **one system rather than seven exercises**: the resources exist, reference each other, support one end-to-end path, and you can say what is not built yet and what comes next. It is marked on evidence and judgement, not on volume.

### 2. The directory, and what is committed

```text
project/checkpoint-01/
├── architecture.md            # 2–3 pages, committed
├── inventory.txt              # GENERATED by the script below, committed
├── evidence/                  # committed - small text and JSON only
│   ├── verify-lab-10.txt
│   ├── verify-lab-13.txt
│   ├── end-to-end.txt
│   └── telemetry-inventory.txt
├── gaps.md                    # what is not built, and what you would do next
└── demo.md                    # the 8-minute path you will walk through
```

Everything in `project/checkpoint-01/` **is** committed, because it is a submission, not a working artefact. So:

- **No secrets, ever**: no access key, no root `.env`, no screenshot showing one.
- **No large files**: evidence is text and JSON; screenshots go in `screenshots/` and `demo.md` links to them.

Confirm before you commit:

```bash
git check-ignore -v project/checkpoint-01/inventory.txt \
  && echo "PROBLEM: this file is ignored and will not be submitted" \
  || echo "correct - project/ is committed"

grep -rIlE 'AKIA|aws_secret_access_key|SecretAccessKey' project/ && echo "STOP: secret found" \
  || echo "no secret patterns found"
```

The `grep` is a floor, not a guarantee. Read what you are committing.

### 3. The inventory script

One command that describes the whole system, reusable for the checkpoint and the final submission.

```bash
cat > scripts/utilities/usms-project-inventory.sh << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One description of the whole USMS system, across every practical.
# Read-only. Safe to run at any time. Writes nothing except its own stdout.
set -uo pipefail

REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
# shellcheck disable=SC1091
source "$REPO_ROOT/configs/course.env"
for f in configs/lab-*.env; do
  # shellcheck disable=SC1090
  [ -f "$f" ] && source "$f"
done

section() { printf '\n== %s ==\n' "$1"; }
count()   { printf '%s' "${1:-0}"; }

printf 'USMS project inventory - %s\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
printf 'account : %s\n' "$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text 2>/dev/null || echo UNREACHABLE)"
printf 'endpoint: %s\n' "${FLOCI_ENDPOINT:-unset}"

  [ -x "$v" ] || continue
  printf '%-40s %s\n' "$v" "$("$v" 2>/dev/null | tail -1)"
done
EOF

chmod +x scripts/utilities/usms-project-inventory.sh
bash -n scripts/utilities/usms-project-inventory.sh && echo "syntax OK"

./scripts/utilities/usms-project-inventory.sh | tee project/checkpoint-01/inventory.txt
```

- Globbing `configs/lab-*.env` is right here (describe whatever exists); every other script names its files (Lab 10 Step 2).
- Every AWS call ends `2>/dev/null || echo "none"`: resources from earlier labs may have been cleaned up, and `none` is a result.
- `tracked secrets` must be `0`; otherwise fix `.gitignore` before submitting.
- The last section prints the final line of every verification script you have.

**Expected result - the shape, not the values**

```

> assessor reads first.

### 4. The end-to-end demonstration

**One path, all the way through**, captured as text (about two minutes):

```bash
{
  printf 'USMS end-to-end demonstration - %s\n\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"

  printf -- '--- 1. identity: who am I, and what may this role do ---\n'
  ./scripts/utilities/whoami.sh
  aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name usms-lambda-exec-role \
    --query 'AttachedPolicies[].PolicyName' --output text

  printf -- '\n--- 2. storage: the bucket four policies have named since Lab 01 ---\n'
  aws s3api head-bucket --bucket usms-student-data && echo "head-bucket: exit 0"

  printf -- '\n--- 3. trigger: what the bucket does when an object arrives ---\n'
  aws s3api get-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket usms-student-data \
    --query 'LambdaFunctionConfigurations[].[Id,LambdaFunctionArn]' --output text

  printf -- '\n--- 4. compute: the function that runs, and the version behind the alias ---\n'
  aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name usms-transcript-notifier \
    --qualifier live --query '[Version,Runtime,TracingConfig.Mode]' --output text

  printf -- '\n--- 5. the event: upload a transcript ---\n'
  ./scripts/utilities/usms-emit-telemetry.sh science 0.63

  printf -- '\n--- 6. logs: what it said ---\n'
  aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /usms/central/application \
    --filter-pattern 'USMS_EVENT' --query 'events[-1].message' --output text

  printf -- '\n--- 7. metrics: what it counted ---\n'
  aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace USMS/Application \
    --query 'Metrics[].MetricName' --output text | tr '\t' '\n' | sort -u

  printf -- '\n--- 8. alarms: what would page somebody ---\n'
  aws cloudwatch describe-alarms \
    --query 'MetricAlarms[].[AlarmName,StateValue,TreatMissingData]' --output text
  aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-types CompositeAlarm \
    --query 'CompositeAlarms[].[AlarmName,AlarmRule]' --output text

  printf -- '\n--- 9. the dashboard somebody would look at ---\n'
  aws cloudwatch get-dashboard --dashboard-name usms-overview \
    --query 'DashboardBody' --output text \
    | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)["widgets"]), "widgets")'
} | tee project/checkpoint-01/evidence/end-to-end.txt
```

Nine stages, each a different practical, captured as text so a doubter can re-run it.

### 5. Capturing the rest of the evidence

```bash
mkdir -p project/checkpoint-01/evidence

./scripts/utilities/verify-lab-10.sh > project/checkpoint-01/evidence/verify-lab-10.txt 2>&1
./scripts/utilities/verify-lab-13.sh > project/checkpoint-01/evidence/verify-lab-13.txt 2>&1
cp outputs/lab-13-telemetry-inventory.txt project/checkpoint-01/evidence/telemetry-inventory.txt

tail -1 project/checkpoint-01/evidence/verify-lab-10.txt
tail -1 project/checkpoint-01/evidence/verify-lab-13.txt
```

A `FAIL` is not automatically a lost mark: an honest `gaps.md` entry explaining it, with evidence the configuration is correct, beats a passing run you cannot explain. An unnoticed `FAIL` costs marks.

### 6. The self-check before you submit

```bash
for f in architecture.md gaps.md demo.md inventory.txt; do
  [ -s "project/checkpoint-01/$f" ] && printf '  ✔ %s\n' "$f" || printf '  ✗ %s missing or empty\n' "$f"
done

[ "$(ls project/checkpoint-01/evidence/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')" -ge 4 ] \
  && echo "  ✔ evidence present" || echo "  ✗ fewer than 4 evidence files"

git ls-files project/checkpoint-01/ | wc -l
git status --short project/
```

After you commit, everything in `project/checkpoint-01/` appears in `git ls-files` and nothing under `outputs/` does. The rubric, demonstration protocol and deadline are in `docs/Lab/project-checkpoint-01.md`.
